# Planning your campaign in CiviCRM

## Key concepts

CiviCampaign is a tool designed to help your non-profit organize, track, and evaluate your outreach and fundraising efforts. It works alongside your existing strategies, allowing you to record and connect all campaign-related activities—such as events, mailings, surveys, and petitions—directly within CiviCRM. This makes it easier to see the full picture of your campaign’s progress and impact.

## Campaign goals and revenue

Start by clearly defining what you want to achieve with your campaign. Document your goals and, if you’re fundraising, note your target revenue. Recording these details in CiviCampaign will help you measure success and learn from each campaign you run.

## Planning your campaign activities

As you plan your campaign, think about:

- **Who you want to reach**: Your campaign’s target audience may be different from the people you’re trying to influence. Understanding your audience helps you choose the right activities and messages.
- **What activities to include**: Consider which events, mailings, surveys, or petitions will support your campaign. Plan how you’ll record each activity in CiviCRM so everything is connected to your campaign.
- **How you’ll gather data**: Decide how you’ll collect information (for example, through event registrations or surveys) and who will be responsible for entering this data into CiviCRM.
- **What reports you’ll need**: Identify which reports will help you monitor progress and evaluate your campaign’s success when it’s complete.

## Key questions to consider

Before you start, take time to answer these questions with your team:

- **Who is our target audience, and how will we reach them?**
- **What activities and strategies (like events or mailings) will be part of this campaign?**
- **How will we collect and enter data during the campaign?**
- **What kind of reports will help us track our progress and evaluate our results?**

## CiviEngage and CiviCampaign

If your organization uses Drupal, you may have access to CiviEngage, which adds extra features for surveys and reporting. For more details, see the section on Civic Engagement.

This page is designed as an **explanation**—it provides background and context to help you understand how CiviCampaign fits into your non-profit’s work, rather than giving step-by-step instructions[3]. If you’re ready to start setting up your campaign, the next section (“Set-up”) will guide you through the process.
