# What is CiviCampaign?

## Overview

CiviCampaign is a tool in CiviCRM that helps your non-profit connect and track all the different activities—like events, mailings, donations, and surveys—that support a single campaign or program goal. This means you can see how all your efforts work together and measure their impact over time.

## How CiviCampaign Works

With CiviCampaign, you can:

- **Create surveys and petitions** to gather feedback or support from your community.
- **Record responses** to these surveys and petitions, keeping everything organized in one place.
- **Link activities** such as donations, emails, and events to a specific campaign, so you know which efforts are part of which goal.
- **Track voter participation** using the Get Out The Vote (GOTV) feature.
- **Record engagement levels** for individual members, so you know who is most involved in your campaign activities.

CiviCampaign works alongside other CiviCRM features, letting you choose which activities count toward your campaign. If you use Drupal, the CiviEngage module adds even more options for surveys and petitions.

## Real-World Example

Imagine your organization is running a year-long campaign to mobilize your community. You might:

- **Create a campaign** as the central hub for all related activities, setting a timeline and a fundraising goal.
- **Build a group** of people you want to involve in the campaign.
- **Call your most active members** to help organize others, and record these calls in CiviCRM, noting the campaign and each member’s response.
- **Send a fundraising email** linked to the campaign, so donations are tracked under that goal.
- **Organize an event** for the campaign, tracking who plans to attend.

Throughout the campaign, you can search and report on all these activities to see how well your outreach is working and make adjustments as needed. At the end, you’ll have a complete picture of your campaign’s success.

## Why This Matters

CiviCampaign helps you stay organized, measure your impact, and make informed decisions about your outreach and fundraising. It’s designed to make complex campaigns manageable, even if you’re new to CiviCRM.
