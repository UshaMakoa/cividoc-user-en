**Note on splitting content:**  
The original “What You Need To Know” page mixes conceptual explanation with practical guidance. Following Diátaxis principles, it’s clearer and more helpful for learners to separate these into distinct pages: one for explanation (background and planning), one for guidance (step-by-step setup), and one for reference (technical details)[1][2][3]. This approach makes it easier for non-profit users to find what they need at each stage of their CiviCRM journey.
