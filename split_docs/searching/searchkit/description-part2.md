## What is a saved search?

A saved search is a search query you create and store in CiviCRM to quickly find contacts or other data later without rebuilding the search from scratch.

## Benefits of saved searches

- Save time by reusing complex searches.
- Share searches with team members.
- Use saved searches as a basis for reports or mailings.

## Basic steps to create a saved search

1. Use the search tools to set your criteria.
2. Run the search to check results.
3. Save the search with a clear title and description.
