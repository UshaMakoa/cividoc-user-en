# Save a search in SearchKit

## What is a saved search?

In SearchKit, a saved search is a way to keep a search you have created so you or others can use it again later without rebuilding it from scratch. There are two types of saved searches:

- **Packaged searches:** Predefined searches that come with SearchKit or extensions. They have preset entities and fields but can be modified or cloned.

- **Custom searches:** Searches you create yourself and save for future use.

## How to save a search

1. **Create your search** in SearchKit by selecting the entity and adding the fields and filters you want.

2. Before saving, go to **Configure Settings** in the left menu to add helpful details:

   - A **descriptive title** that clearly explains what the search does.

   - An optional **description** to provide more context.

   - **Tags** to help find the search later (for example, by department or staff member).

   - An optional **expiration date** if the search is only relevant for a limited time.

3. Click **Save** to store the search.

## Managing saved searches

After saving, your search will appear on the SearchKit landing page with its title, description, entity, tags, creation date, and last modified user.

You can take these actions on saved searches:

- **Edit:** Change the title, description, tags, and other settings. Note: You cannot change the entity of the search after saving.

- **View results:** Run the search to see the current data.

- **Clone:** Make a copy of the search to create a variation without starting over.

- **Export:** Copy the search configuration to import it into another site or share it.

- **Delete:** Remove the saved search if no longer needed.

## Important notes

- Once saved, the **entity (e.g., Contacts, Contributions)** for the search cannot be changed. If you need a search on a different entity, create a new search.

- Use clear, descriptive titles and tags to make it easy for you and your team to find saved searches later.

- Saving searches helps you work more efficiently by reusing complex queries without rebuilding them each time.
