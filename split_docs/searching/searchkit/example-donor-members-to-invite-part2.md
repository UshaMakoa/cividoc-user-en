# Understanding Search Kit basics (optional)  

## What is Search Kit?  
Search Kit is a tool in CiviCRM that helps you build custom searches by combining different types of data, like contacts, memberships, events, and contributions. It lets you filter, group, and transform data to create lists tailored to your needs.

## Why use Search Kit?  
It’s flexible and powerful for non-technical users to find exactly the contacts or records they need without writing code.

## Getting started tips  
- Always choose the base entity carefully (e.g., Contacts if you want a list of people).  
- Use **With (required)** to include related data that must exist.  
- Use **Without** to exclude records with certain related data.  
- Use **Group By** and **Field Transformations** to summarize data like totals or counts.
