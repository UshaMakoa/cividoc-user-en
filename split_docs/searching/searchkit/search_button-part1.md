# Search button

## What is the search button?

The search button in CiviCRM lets you run searches to find contacts, contributions, events, or other information stored in your system. You need to click this button every time you want to see the results of your search criteria.

## How to use the search button

1. **Set your search criteria**  
   Fill in the fields or select filters that describe what you want to find. For example, you might enter a name, date range, or status.

2. **Click the search button**  
   After entering your criteria, click the search button to run the search. This will show you the matching results.

3. **View and use your results**  
   The results list will display the contacts or records that match your search. From here, you can take actions like exporting data, sending emails, or updating records.

## Important notes

- You must click the search button every time you change your search settings to refresh the results.  
- If you do not click the search button, the results will not update and may be empty or outdated.  
- The search button helps you control when the system runs a search, which can save time and system resources.

## Example: Finding contacts with upcoming events

- Enter the date range for upcoming events in the search fields.  
- Set any other filters you want, such as event type or participant status.  
- Click the search button to see the list of contacts registered for those events.

## Tips for successful searching

- Be as specific as possible with your criteria to get useful results.  
- Use multiple filters if needed to narrow down your search.  
- Remember to click the search button after each change.
