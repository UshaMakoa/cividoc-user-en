# Giving Your Saved Searches Clear Titles

## Why Titles Matter

When you save a search in CiviCRM Search Kit, giving it a clear, descriptive title helps you and your team quickly find and understand what the search is for. This is especially important in busy non-profit environments where many people may be using the system.

## How to Choose a Good Title

Think about what makes this search unique or important. A good title tells you at a glance what the search does—for example, “Fundraising: Contributions by Year by Contact” or “Events: Upcoming Volunteer Opportunities.” If your organization has a naming convention (like starting with a department name), follow that to keep things organized.

## Tips for Effective Titles

- **Be specific**: Avoid vague titles like “New Search.” Instead, describe the purpose or the group of contacts, events, or donations the search covers.
- **Use consistent patterns**: If your team agrees on a standard way to name searches (such as starting with the department or entity), everyone will find what they need faster.
- **Keep it simple**: Use plain language that everyone on your team understands, avoiding technical jargon.

## Example Titles

- **Fundraising: Major Donors This Year**
- **Volunteers: Active but Not Yet Assigned**
- **Events: Registrations Needing Follow-Up**

## Remember

A well-named search saves time and reduces confusion. Take a moment to give each saved search a title that will make sense to your whole team, not just to you.
