# Search button actions

## What you can do with search results

After running a search and seeing your results, you can perform actions such as:

- Exporting the list to a spreadsheet  
- Sending emails or mailings to selected contacts  
- Adding contacts to groups or tags  
- Updating records in bulk  

## How to save your search

Some search screens allow you to save your search criteria for future use. Look for a "Save search" option and give your search a clear name.

## Troubleshooting

- If your search returns no results, check your criteria for typos or overly restrictive filters.  
- If the search button does not seem to work, try refreshing your browser or clearing your cache.
