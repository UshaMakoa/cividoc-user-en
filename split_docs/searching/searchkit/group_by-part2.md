# Understanding search results and actions after grouping

## Viewing grouped results

After grouping your search results, each row represents a group of records sharing the same values in the selected fields. You can see totals, counts, or other summary data depending on the fields.

## Changing the display order

You can rearrange the columns in your grouped results by dragging them left or right. After changing the order, click **Search** again to refresh the results with the new column order.

## Taking actions on grouped data

Depending on your search and permissions, you may be able to perform actions on the groups or drill down to see the individual records within each group.

## Saving your grouped search

You can save your search with the group by settings to reuse it later. This saves time if you regularly analyze the same data groups.
