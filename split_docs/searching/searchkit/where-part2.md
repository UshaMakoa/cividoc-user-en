This rewrite is a **Basic-level Guide** aimed at non-expert nonprofit users learning how to apply filters in CiviCRM Search Kit. It uses plain English, clear structure, and encouraging tone to help users understand and apply the "Where" filter effectively. Splitting complex topics like "Having" into another page is recommended for clarity and ease of learning.
