# Query info

## What is Query info?

Query Info shows you the technical details behind your search in CiviCRMâ€™s Search Kit. It reveals the actual API calls and SQL queries that the system uses to find the results you requested. This is useful if you want to understand how your search works or if you need to reuse or customize the query outside of Search Kit.

## Why use Query info?

- To see exactly how your search criteria translate into API or SQL commands.  
- To copy these queries for use in custom reports or integrations.  
- To troubleshoot or optimize complex searches by understanding their structure.  

## Where to find Query info

When you build a search using Search Kit, after setting your filters and display options, look for the **Query Info** option or button. Clicking it will open a panel showing the API and SQL code behind your search.

## Understanding the Query info output

- **API format:** This shows the CiviCRM API call that matches your search. It uses JSON-like syntax to describe what data is requested and how it is filtered.  
- **SQL format:** This shows the actual SQL query sent to the database. It is useful if you want to run the query directly in a database tool or understand performance.  

## How to use Query info safely

- Use the API query if you want to integrate the search into custom scripts or extensions.  
- Use the SQL query if you have database access and want to run or modify the search at the database level.  
- Be cautious when modifying SQL queries directly; incorrect changes can cause errors or unexpected results.  
- Query Info is intended for users comfortable with technical details; if you are new to CiviCRM, focus first on building searches using the graphical interface.

## Example: Copying a query for reuse

1. Build your search in Search Kit with the filters and columns you want.  
2. Click **Query Info** to open the detailed view.  
3. Copy the API or SQL code shown.  
4. Paste the API code into your custom API calls or the SQL into your database tool.  

This allows you to automate or extend your searches beyond the standard interface.

## Summary

Query Info is a powerful feature in CiviCRM Search Kit that helps intermediate users understand and reuse the technical queries behind their searches. It bridges the gap between the user-friendly search builder and the underlying data retrieval mechanisms.
