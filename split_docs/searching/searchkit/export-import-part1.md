## exporting saved searches

To export a saved SearchKit search, follow these steps:

1. **Access the SearchKit Page**: Go to the main SearchKit page in your CiviCRM system.
2. **Select the Saved Search**: Choose the saved search you want to export from the list of available searches.
3. **Export the Search**: Click on the "Export" option from the additional actions menu (⋮) beside your saved search.
4. **Copy the Search Code**: A window will display the coded version of your search. Use the convenient button to copy the search to your clipboard.
5. **Include Associated Elements**: If you have created associated displays, groups, or forms, you can include them in the export as well.
6. **Save or Share the Search**: Once copied, you can save the search in a file for future reference, import it into another site, or send it to someone else for them to use and modify on their system.

**Note**: If you need to include the saved search in a custom extension, use the "API Explorer Export" instead. You will find the link at the top of the export window.

## importing saved searches

To import a saved SearchKit search into your CiviCRM system, follow these steps:

2. **Find the Import Link**: Click on the "Import" link just under the "New Search" button in the top right corner.
3. **Paste the Exported Search**: A window will appear with an empty box. Paste the exported search code into this box.
4. **Submit the Import**: Click submit, and you will be returned to the main screen where you can see your newly imported search.
