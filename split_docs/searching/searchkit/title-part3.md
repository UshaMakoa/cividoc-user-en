# Organizing and Managing Saved Searches

## Keeping Searches Organized

As your team creates more searches, it’s important to keep them organized. Use consistent naming, add descriptions if needed, and consider archiving old searches you no longer use.

## Sharing Searches

Saved searches can be shared with other users who have the right permissions. This is a great way to collaborate and ensure everyone has access to the information they need.

## Updating and Deleting Searches

You can edit a saved search to change its criteria or title, or delete it if it’s no longer needed. Regular reviews help keep your search list clean and useful.
