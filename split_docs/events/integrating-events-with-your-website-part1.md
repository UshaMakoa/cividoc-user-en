# Integrating events with your website

## Overview

If you want to promote your events and make it easy for people to register, you can display CiviCRM events directly on your website. This guide walks you through the basic steps to link your events to your site, whether you use Joomla!, WordPress, or Drupal. You’ll also learn how to offer an RSS feed of upcoming events for your visitors.

## Linking to event registration pages

To share an event with your website visitors, you first need the event’s registration link from CiviCRM.

1. Go to **Events > Manage Events** in your CiviCRM menu.
2. Click **Event Links** for your chosen event.
3. Copy the URL for the **event info page** or **registration page**. You can use either link on your website—the registration page is also available from the info page.

You can add this link to any page, button, or menu item on your website. This is a simple way to direct visitors to your event details and registration form.

## Adding events in Joomla!

If your website uses Joomla!, you can add a direct link to your event in the site menu.

1. Log in to your Joomla! control panel.
2. Go to **Menu Manager > [Your menu name]**.
3. Click **New** to add a menu item.
4. Expand **CiviCRM > CiviCRM Events** and select **Event Info**.
5. Choose your event from the **Select an Event** list.
6. Click **Save**.

Now, your event will appear in your Joomla! menu, making it easy for visitors to find and register.

## Adding events in WordPress

WordPress users can embed the event registration form directly into a page or post using a shortcode.

- Edit the page or post where you want the event to appear.
- Insert the CiviCRM event shortcode provided by your CiviCRM WordPress integration plugin.
- Save or update the page. The event registration form will now display on your site.

## Displaying events in Drupal

Drupal offers flexible options for listing events using the Views module.

- Use the **Views** module to create a list of upcoming CiviCRM events.
- Customize the display to match your site’s design.
- For detailed instructions, refer to the **Website integration** chapter in your CiviCRM documentation.

This approach automatically updates your event listings as you add new events in CiviCRM.

## Providing an RSS feed of upcoming events

You can also let visitors subscribe to all your upcoming events via RSS.

1. Go to **Events > Manage Events**.
2. Click the orange and white square icon (RSS) in the top right.
3. Copy the RSS feed URL.
4. Share this link on your website, or use your content management system to display the feed directly on a page.

Many website platforms allow you to embed RSS feeds, so your event listings stay up to date automatically.

## Tips for success

- **Test your links**: Always check that your event links work correctly from your website.
- **Update regularly**: If you use manual links, remember to update them when you create new events.
- **Promote your events**: Share event pages and RSS feeds in newsletters, social media, and other communications.

By following these steps, you can make it easy for your community to discover and register for your events, helping you reach more people and grow your impact.
