# Scheduled reminders for repeating events

## Setting up reminders that repeat

To make sure your attendees get reminders for each occurrence of a repeating event:

1. Open the original event before setting it to repeat.
2. Go to the **Scheduled Reminders** section.
3. Create reminders that send messages a set number of days or weeks before the event date.
4. Avoid setting reminders to repeat on fixed calendar days, as this can cause confusion with repeated events.
5. After saving reminders, proceed to set up your repeating event as described earlier.

This approach ensures reminders adjust automatically for each event occurrence.
