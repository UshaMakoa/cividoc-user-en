If you decide to split the content, a new page could focus on **Advanced Setup Options** or **Troubleshooting Common Issues**. 

Here's an example of how the new page might look:

---
categories: Guide
level: Intermediate
summary: This guide covers advanced setup options for petitions in CiviCRM.
section: Petitions
---

# advanced petition setup

## advanced cms permissions
For more complex scenarios, you might need to set additional permissions or configure custom access controls.

## customizing petition responses
You can further customize how petition responses are captured and displayed by adding more custom fields or adjusting profile settings.

This approach keeps each page focused on a specific set of tasks or concepts, making it easier for users to find the information they need.
