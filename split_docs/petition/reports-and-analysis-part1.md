# viewing and analyzing petition results

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help you understand how to view and analyze petition signatures and results in CiviCRM. It assumes you have basic familiarity with navigating the CiviCRM interface.

## Viewing Petition Signatures
To view who has signed a petition, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Campaign > Dashboard > Petitions**.
2. Click **More > Signatures** next to the name of your petition.

## Reviewing Petition Results with Activity Reports
To review the results from a petition, use the Activity Report:

1. Navigate to **Reports > Create Reports from Templates > Activity Report**.
2. In the **Display Column** area, select any fields you want to view, such as **Target Contact Email**.
3. Expand the **Petition Questions** area and select the criteria you want to see, such as specific responses to a petition question.
4. Click **Preview Report** to view the results. You can also export the report information to a CSV file for more detailed analysis.

If the content becomes too complex or extensive, consider splitting it into multiple pages. For example, you could have one page focused on viewing signatures and another on using activity reports for analysis.

### Suggested Split (if necessary):
#### Viewing Petition Signatures
- Focus on the steps to view who has signed a petition.

#### Analyzing Petition Results
- Focus on using Activity Reports to analyze petition outcomes.
