To re-write the provided page using the Di√°taxis framework, let's break it down into its core components and identify the best fit for each section.

### Overview of Organizing Data in CiviCRM

The content primarily focuses on helping users understand how to organize their data in CiviCRM, which involves planning and mapping existing data into the system. This process is crucial for non-profit users who are not experts in CiviCRM but want to effectively manage their data.

### Categorization

Given the nature of the content, it seems to blend elements of **Explanation** and **Guide**. However, since the primary goal is to help users understand how to organize their data effectively, it leans more towards a **Guide**. The content provides practical advice on how to assess current data systems, plan for data migration, and adapt workflows to CiviCRM's structure.

### Level

The level of this content is **Basic** to **Intermediate**. It assumes some familiarity with data management concepts but does not require advanced technical knowledge of CiviCRM.

### Summary

Here is a one-sentence summary:
"Learn how to organize your data effectively in CiviCRM by understanding your current data systems, planning for data migration, and adapting your workflows."

### Suggested Structure

### Splitting Content

If the content is extensive or covers multiple complex topics, consider splitting it into separate pages. For example:

1. **Assessing Current Data Systems**: Focus on understanding existing data storage methods and identifying key contacts and interactions.
2. **Planning for Data Migration**: Discuss how to evaluate data for relevance, standardize data formats, and prepare for migration.
3. **Adapting Workflows to CiviCRM**: Provide guidance on how to adjust organizational processes to leverage CiviCRM's features effectively.

Each of these sections could be a separate page, allowing users to focus on one aspect at a time.
