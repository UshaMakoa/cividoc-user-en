# Creating and managing repeating activities

## Introduction

If your organization has regular meetings, check-ins, or tasks, you can save time by setting up repeating activities. This tutorial will guide you through creating and managing these recurring records.

## Steps to create a repeating activity

1. **Go to a contact record** and click **Actions > New Activity**.
2. **Fill in the activity details** (type, subject, date, etc.).
3. **Find the “Repeat Activity” section** (usually near the bottom of the form).
4. **Set the repetition options**:
   - **Start date and time**: When the first activity happens.
   - **Repeats every**: Choose how often (hour, day, week, month, year).
   - **Repeats on**: For weekly repeats, select which days.
   - **Ends**: Set an end date or a number of occurrences.
   - **Exclude dates**: Add any dates when the activity should not repeat.
5. **Click Save**. CiviCRM will show a confirmation screen with all the dates for the repeating activities.
6. **Review the list** and make any needed adjustments.

## Managing repeating activities

- **Edit a single instance**: Changes affect only that occurrence.
- **Edit this and all future**: Changes apply to this and all following repeats.
- **Edit all**: Changes apply to every instance in the series.
- **Delete**: You can delete individual instances or the entire series.

## Tips

- **Date and time changes** only apply to the instance you’re editing, not the whole series.
- **Use the activity dashboard** to keep track of upcoming and past activities.
- **Custom fields** can be added to collect extra information for each activity.

By following these steps, you’ll streamline the process of recording regular interactions and ensure your team’s work is well documented.

**Note:** If your organization has complex workflows or advanced reporting needs, consider splitting these topics into separate, more detailed guides or tutorials as your team’s skills grow. The Diátaxis framework encourages starting with clear, focused content and expanding as needed[1][4].
