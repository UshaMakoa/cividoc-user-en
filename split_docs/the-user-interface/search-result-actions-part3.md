# Exporting data from search results

## Before you begin

Search for the records you want to export and select them. You can export contacts, contributions, participants, activities, or memberships.

## Step 1: Search and select records

Use your preferred search tool to find the records, then select the ones you want to export.

## Step 2: Open the Actions menu

Click the “Actions” button at the top of your search results.

## Step 3: Choose “Export”

Select the export option that matches your record type (for example, “Export Contacts” or “Export Contributions”).

## Step 4: Choose your export format

Select the fields you want to include and choose a file format (usually CSV for spreadsheets).

## Step 5: Download your file

Click “Export” to download your data. You can now open the file in Excel, Google Sheets, or another tool.

## Tips

- You can save your export settings as a mapping for future use.
- Exported files are useful for mail merges, reporting, or sharing data with colleagues.
- Always check that you have selected the correct records before exporting.

For more advanced tasks, such as updating custom fields or setting up profiles for bulk edits, consider creating separate tutorial or guide pages focused on those specific workflows. This keeps each page focused, clear, and easy for new users to follow, in line with the Diátaxis framework[1][2][5].
