# Pledges reports and analysis

## Understanding pledge reports

CiviCRM provides built-in pledge reports that help you see details about the pledges your supporters have made. These reports give you useful information like how much was pledged, how much has been paid, and what payments are still due.

The two main reports are:

- **Pledge detail report**: Shows information for each contact who made a pledge, including the amount pledged, current status, next payment date, balance due, and total amount paid.

- **Pledged but not paid report**: Lists pledges that are not yet complete but have a payment due date in the past, helping you identify outstanding payments.

## Using and customizing reports

These reports come pre-configured to show common pledge information, but you can create your own reports if you need to see different details or organize the data differently. To do this, you start from the relevant report template and adjust it to fit your needs.

There is also a **Pledge summary report template** that can be used to create reports summarizing total pledge amounts by categories like city or the month when the pledge was made.

## Tips for non-expert users

- Use the pledge reports regularly to keep track of your fundraising goals and follow up on unpaid pledges.

- If you want to see specific information not in the default reports, consider creating a custom report using the templates.

- Don’t worry if you’re new to reporting—start with the built-in reports and explore creating custom reports as you become more comfortable.
