# Understanding SMS activity types

## Inbound SMS

Inbound SMS are messages your organization receives from contacts. Reporting on inbound SMS helps you track responses and engagement.

## Mass SMS

Mass SMS are bulk messages sent to many contacts at once. Use reports to check which groups received messages and when.

## SMS delivery

SMS delivery activities show the status of sent messages, such as delivered, failed, or pending. Monitoring delivery helps ensure your messages reach their recipients.
