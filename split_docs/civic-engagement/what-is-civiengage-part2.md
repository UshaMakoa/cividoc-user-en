# Getting started with CiviEngage

This guide walks you through the basic steps to set up and begin using CiviEngage for your community organizing work. If you are new to CiviEngage or CiviCRM, this guide will help you take your first steps with confidence.

## Before you begin

- **Check your system:** Make sure your website uses Drupal 7 and has CiviCRM installed.
- **Install CiviEngage:** CiviEngage is included with CiviCRM for Drupal 7. If you do not see it, check with your site administrator.
- **Enable the module:** Go to your Drupal modules page and enable CiviEngage.

## Setting up your first campaign

1. **Plan your campaign:** Decide what you want to achieve—for example, increasing attendance at an event or gathering survey responses from a neighborhood.
2. **Create a campaign:** In CiviCRM, go to Campaigns and create a new campaign. Give it a clear name and description.
3. **Set up your survey (if needed):** If you are doing canvassing or phone banking, create a survey in CiviSurvey with the questions you want to ask.
4. **Add your team:** Assign staff or volunteers to help with outreach and data entry.

## Creating walk lists and call lists

1. **Identify your audience:** Use CiviCRM’s search tools to find the people you want to contact, based on location, interests, or past involvement.
2. **Generate your list:** Use CiviEngage’s walk list or phone bank list reports to create a list of contacts for your team.
3. **Distribute the list:** Share the list with your volunteers or staff, either as a printed report or digitally.

## Recording and tracking responses

1. **Engage your community:** Volunteers or staff contact people on the list, using the survey questions you prepared.
2. **Enter the data:** After each contact, record the responses in CiviCRM. This could be done by volunteers on paper forms that are later entered, or directly into the system if they have access.
3. **Follow up:** Use CiviCRM to track who has been contacted, who needs a follow-up, and who has committed to attend an event or take action.

## Analyzing your results

1. **Run reports:** Use CiviEngage’s custom reports to see how many people were contacted, how many responded, and what they said.
2. **Review your campaign:** Look at the data to understand what worked and what could be improved for next time.
3. **Plan next steps:** Use what you learn to adjust your strategy and keep building relationships with your community.

## Tips for success

- **Keep your data clean:** Regularly update contact information and remove duplicates.
- **Train your team:** Make sure everyone knows how to use CiviCRM and CiviEngage for their tasks.
- **Celebrate your wins:** Share successes with your team and community to keep everyone motivated.

By following these steps, you can start using CiviEngage to organize, track, and learn from your community engagement work—even if you are new to CiviCRM.
