# Creating and using a walk list in CiviEngage

## Introduction

A walk list helps your team organize door-to-door canvassing by providing a list of addresses and key information for each contact. This tutorial guides you through creating and using a walk list in CiviEngage.

## Steps

**1. Prepare your contact data**  
Make sure your contacts have accurate, standardized address information. Clean your data if needed.

**2. Create a Smart Group**  
Go to Contacts > New Smart Group. Set criteria to target the audience you want to canvass (e.g., by location, interest, or voter status).

**3. Generate the walk list**  
With your Smart Group selected, choose “Export” and select the fields you need for canvassing (name, address, phone, notes). Export the list as a CSV file.

**4. Distribute the list**  
Share the CSV file with your canvassing team. They can use it on their devices or print it for field work.

**5. Record responses**  
After canvassing, have your team record survey responses or notes in CiviCRM. You can use CiviEngage’s survey tools to capture this data directly.

**6. Review and update**  
After the campaign, review the data collected. Update contact records and use the information to plan future outreach.

## Tips

- Double-check addresses before exporting to avoid wasted trips.
- Use custom fields to track specific information collected during canvassing.
- Train your team on how to enter data accurately in CiviCRM.

**Rationale for splitting:**  
The original “What You Need To Know” page mixes conceptual explanations with setup and task guidance. Following the Diátaxis framework, these have been separated into distinct pages—Explanation for concepts, Guide for setup steps, and Tutorial for a specific, practical task—to better serve non-expert users learning to use CiviEngage[1][4][5]. Each page is clearly labeled by category and level, using plain, inclusive language as requested.
