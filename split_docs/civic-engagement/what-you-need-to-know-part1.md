# What you need to know about CiviEngage

## Understanding CiviEngage

CiviEngage is designed to help non-profit organizations manage interactions with constituents during civic engagement and community organizing activities, such as canvassing and phone banking. This section explains the key concepts you need to get started and suggests important questions to guide your planning.

## Key concepts

**CiviEngage and CiviCampaign**  
CiviEngage works closely with CiviCampaign to support community organizing. Together, they let you create and conduct surveys and petitions, analyze responses, and record engagement levels for your contacts. For more on campaigns, see the Campaign chapter.

**Custom fields and profiles**  
CiviEngage includes special custom field sets for tracking information important to civic engagement, like walk lists and phone bank lists. These help you collect and organize responses from your community. Learn more about custom fields in the Organizing Your Data chapter.

**Cleaning your address data**  
Accurate address data is essential for generating reliable walk lists and reports. Before importing data, make sure addresses follow standard formats. This ensures better search results and more effective outreach.

**Disabling vs. deleting custom data**  
If you no longer need certain custom fields or groups, disable them instead of deleting. This prevents problems with existing reports and searches that might rely on that data.

**Working with your universe of contacts**  
Use Smart Groups and regular Groups to target specific audiences for your campaigns—for example, by demographics, interests, or language. These groups help you create focused walk lists and phone bank lists. Learn more in the Tags and Groups section.

**Working with voter history**  
CiviEngage lets you manage voter history and other electoral information. After a campaign, you can import only the most relevant voter data to keep your contact records up to date for future engagement.

**Custom contact subtypes**  
CiviEngage adds new contact subtypes for Individuals and Organizations, such as Media Contact, Funder Contact, Elected Official, Media Outlet, and Foundation. These let you track and communicate with specific types of contacts more effectively.

## Key questions

As you plan your civic engagement work, consider:

- Who are your organization’s constituents, and what issues matter to them?
- Who else is important to your work (community leaders, donors, elected officials, media, funders)?
- What information do you need about your constituents to create targeted communications?
- Will you do voter engagement work, and how will you use the results to improve your contact data?

These questions help you make the most of CiviEngage and ensure your outreach is as effective as possible.
