# Creating and managing surveys in CiviCRM

## Step 1: Create custom fields for your survey questions

- Go to **Administer > Custom Data and Screens > Custom Fields**.  
- Create a new custom field set for your survey questions.  
- Add fields for each question, choosing the appropriate field type (e.g., multiple choice, text).  
- Save your custom fields.

## Step 2: Build a profile to display your survey

- Navigate to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Profiles**.  
- Create a new profile or edit an existing one.  
- Add the custom fields you created for the survey to this profile.  
- Configure the profile settings to control how questions appear.

## Step 3: Reserve respondents by creating or selecting a group

- Go to **Contacts > Manage Groups**.  
- Create a new group or select an existing group of contacts to survey.  
- This group represents your reserved respondents.

## Step 4: Launch your survey

- Use the survey tool in CiviCampaign to link the profile and reserved group.  
- Send invitations or share the survey link with your contacts.  
- Monitor responses and release contacts from the group once they complete the survey.

## Tips for success

- Keep surveys short and focused to encourage completion.  
- Test your survey with a small group before wider distribution.  
- Use consistent response options where possible to simplify analysis.
