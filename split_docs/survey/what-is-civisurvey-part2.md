(To be developed as a separate guide or tutorial page focusing on step-by-step instructions for creating surveys, managing respondents, entering responses, and generating reports.)

This structure follows the Diataxis framework by providing an **Explanation** at a **Basic** level, suitable for non-expert non-profit users who are learning what CiviSurvey is and how it fits into their work. Splitting the content into multiple pages is recommended to separate conceptual understanding from practical step-by-step instructions.
