# What you need to know about surveys in CiviCRM

## Introduction

This guide helps you understand the basics of using the survey tool in CiviCampaign, a part of CiviCRM. It covers important concepts and practical steps to prepare for creating and managing surveys, even if you are new to the system.

## Key concepts

- **Surveys use profiles to collect responses.** You create custom fields for your survey questions and then build a profile that displays these questions to participants.  
- **Respondents are “reserved” in groups.** Before you send out a survey, you select or create a group of contacts to answer it. Once they respond, they are “released” from this group.  
- **Surveys are for existing contacts.** If you want to survey people outside your contacts, consider using the Petition tool instead.  
- **Surveys are part of CiviCampaign.** You need to enable CiviCampaign to use surveys, but you don’t have to link a survey to a campaign if you want to run a general survey.  
- **Drupal users need permissions set.** If your site uses Drupal, make sure the right roles have permission to reserve and release contacts for surveys.

## Preparing your survey

- Decide if the survey is linked to a campaign or a general organisational activity. Linking helps with analysing results alongside other campaign data.  
- Plan your questions and response types. Use multiple choice for easier analysis or open-ended questions for detailed feedback.  
- For more than three questions, consider whether a petition might be a better tool.  
- Identify who will conduct the survey and how responses will be entered into CiviCRM.  
- Choose the group of contacts you want to survey carefully.
