# Understanding surveys in the context of CiviCRM

## How surveys fit into CiviCRM

Surveys are a feature of the **CiviCampaign** component, designed to help organisations gather structured feedback from their contacts. They are built using **profiles** that display questions linked to **custom fields**.

## Relationship with campaigns

- Surveys can be connected to specific campaigns to track responses alongside other campaign activities.  
- Alternatively, surveys can be independent of campaigns, useful for general feedback like membership satisfaction.

## Enhancements with CiviEngage

- For Drupal users with the **CiviEngage** module enabled, surveys gain extra features such as tracking response statuses more effectively.  
- This integration helps manage and analyse engagement more comprehensively.

## Permissions and security

- Drupal sites require setting permissions for roles to manage survey respondents securely.  
- Proper permissions ensure only authorised users can reserve and release contacts for surveys.

Understanding these connections helps you see how surveys support broader engagement and campaign strategies within CiviCRM.
