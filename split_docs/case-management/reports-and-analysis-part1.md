To re-write the documentation page for non-profit users of CiviCRM using the Di√°taxis framework, here's a suggested approach:

### Categories and Level

Based on the content, this page could be categorized as a **Guide** because it provides practical directions for achieving specific tasks related to reports and analysis in CiviCRM. The level of this guide would be **Intermediate** since it assumes some familiarity with CiviCRM and its case management features.

### Summary

Here is a one-sentence summary of the page:

This guide helps users understand how to create and manage reports and analyses for case management in CiviCRM, including customizing views and using search features.

### Markdown Structure

Here's how the top of the page could look in Markdown:

```markdown
---
categories: Guide
level: Intermediate
summary: This guide helps users understand how to create and manage reports and analyses for case management in CiviCRM, including customizing views and using search features.
section: Case Management
---

# reports and analysis in case management
## introduction to case management reports
```

### Content Suggestions

1. **Introduction to Case Management Reports**: Explain the importance of reports in case management and how CiviCRM supports this.

2. **Creating Customized Views**: Describe how to use CiviCRM's search features and CiviReport to create detailed and customized views of case data.

3. **Using CiviCase Reports**: Detail the four report templates available for cases and how to use them effectively.

4. **Printing and Exporting Reports**: Provide steps on how to print case reports and export documents using case tokens.

5. **Advanced Search and Analysis**: Discuss how to use advanced search options and activity searches to further analyze case data.

### Splitting the Content

If the content becomes too extensive, consider splitting it into multiple pages based on simpler or more complex subjects. For example:

- **Basic Case Management Reports**: Focus on the basic reports and how to access them.
- **Advanced Case Management Analysis**: Cover more complex searches and custom report creation.
