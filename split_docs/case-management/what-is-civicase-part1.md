# what is civicase?
CiviCase is a powerful tool in CiviCRM designed to help organizations manage complex interactions with contacts. It functions similarly to a case management system, allowing you to track and manage interactions efficiently.

## scenarios for using civicase
CiviCase can be used in various scenarios to streamline organizational processes:

- **Managing Legislator-Constituent Interactions**: Legislative staff can use CiviCase to manage interactions with constituents, track activities, and avoid duplicating work. For example, if a constituent calls about an issue, staff can view related activities and inform the caller about ongoing work.
  
- **Complex Application Process**: Organizations can use CiviCase to manage multi-step application processes. For instance, a health department grant program might use CiviCase to track applications through different stages of assessment.

## how civicase works
CiviCase relies heavily on **Activities** in CiviCRM. Understanding how activities work will help you grasp CiviCase more easily. Here's a simple example of CiviCase in action:

- **Housing Support Case**: When a case is opened, activities like medical evaluations and temporary housing arrangements are automatically scheduled. Different roles, such as a Homeless Service Coordinator, Health Services Coordinator, and Benefits Specialist, can be involved in managing these cases.

### key features of civicase
- **Tracks Complex Interactions**: CiviCase helps manage sequences of interactions that involve multiple staff members.
- **Avoids Duplication**: It ensures that no duplicate work is done by allowing staff to see what activities are already being handled.
- **Automates Follow-ups**: CiviCase automates the process of scheduling follow-up activities, ensuring that important tasks are not forgotten.

### benefits of using civicase
- **Efficient Management**: CiviCase streamlines organizational processes by providing a clear overview of ongoing cases and activities.
- **Improved Collaboration**: It facilitates collaboration among staff by assigning tasks and tracking progress.
