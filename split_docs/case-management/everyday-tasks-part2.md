# Getting started with case management in CiviCRM

## What is a case?

A case in CiviCRM is a way to track work related to a specific client or issue. It helps organize activities, communications, and roles in one place.

## Why use cases?

Cases help your team:

- Keep track of ongoing work  
- Assign tasks and roles clearly  
- Maintain an audit trail of communications and activities  
- Generate reports to understand case progress  

## Basic concepts

- **Case types:** Define the kind of work or issue (e.g., legal aid, housing support).  
- **Case roles:** Define who is involved and their responsibilities.  
- **Activities:** Tasks or communications related to the case.  
- **Status:** Current state of the case (e.g., ongoing, resolved).

This rewrite breaks the original content into two pages for clarity: one detailed guide on everyday tasks, and a separate introductory page for beginners. It uses plain English, an encouraging tone, and follows the Diataxis framework by labeling the content as a **Guide** at a **Basic** level, suitable for non-expert nonprofit users learning case management in CiviCRM[1][2][5].
