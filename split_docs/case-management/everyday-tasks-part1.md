# Everyday tasks in CiviCase

## Viewing the case dashboard

The case dashboard helps you keep track of your cases and tasks. It shows:

- A summary of all cases you are involved in  
- Your cases with upcoming activities scheduled in the next 14 days  
- Your cases with activities completed in the last 14 days  

If you have permission, you can also view all cases with upcoming or recent activities. Switch between "Your Cases" and "All Cases" using the link at the top right.

To work on a task, click the edit icon next to the activity name. Click the triangle next to a client’s name to see all activities in that case. Use the "Manage Case" button to handle multiple tasks, change case status, print reports, or view roles.

To add a new case, click the "Add Case" button at the top left of the dashboard.

## Finding cases

You can find cases by:

- Using full-text search with the Case ID or keywords  
- Going to Search > Find Cases or the Cases menu  

You can filter searches by client name or email, case type, case status, and whether to include deleted cases. Multiple filters combine to narrow down results.

## Opening a new case

You can open a case for an existing contact or create a new contact at the same time.

To open a case for an existing contact:

1. Go to the contact’s summary screen.  
2. Select "Add Case" from the Actions menu or the Cases tab.  
3. Fill in the required fields and save.  

To open a case for a new contact:

1. Go to Cases > New Case or use the "Create New > Case" button.  
2. Search for the contact to avoid duplicates; if not found, create a new contact in the pop-up form.  
3. Fill in details like Medium (how the case came to your attention), Location, Subject (a brief unique description), Case Type, Status, Start Date, and Duration (time spent gathering info).  
4. Save the case and start managing activities and roles.

## Managing a case

The Manage Case page lets you:

- View case summary  
- Change case status or reassign  
- Create and manage activities and timelines  
- Assign case roles  
- Manage client relationships  
- Run case audits and reports  

## Assigning case roles

Assign roles to contacts involved in the case to keep them informed and allow them to see the case in their dashboard.

To assign a role:

1. Open the Case Roles section.  
2. Click the edit icon next to an unassigned role.  
3. Search and select the contact.  
4. Confirm to assign the role.

You can add multiple contacts to the same role using the "Add New Role" button. If a contact is not in the database, add them first under Contacts > New Individual.

You can email contacts with roles directly from the case, and emails are automatically logged as case activities.

## Bulk adding contacts to a case role

To add many contacts to a case role at once:

1. Search for contacts.  
2. Select the contacts to add.  
3. Choose "Add to case as role" action.  
4. Select the case and role, then submit.

## Finding activities within a case

Open the Case Activities section to see scheduled and completed activities. Use column headers to sort or the Search Filters button to filter by reporter, status, date, activity type, or deleted activities.

## Adding and managing activities

To add a new activity:

1. Open the case.  
2. Select an activity type from the "New Activity" dropdown.  
3. Fill out the form and save.

You can also add a set of activities (a timeline) by selecting a timeline from the "New Timeline" dropdown and confirming.

You can send copies of activities to contacts with case roles, schedule follow-up activities, and add attachments (up to five files per activity).

## Editing an activity

To edit an activity:

1. Find the case and scroll to activities.  
2. Click Edit next to the activity.  
3. Update fields and save.

You can assign or change staff assigned to an activity by typing their name in the "Assigned to" field.

## Updating activity status quickly

Click the status text (e.g., "Scheduled") in the activities table to open a pop-up form, select a new status, and save.

## Changing case status

To update the overall case status:

1. Open the case and click "Manage Case."  
2. Click the edit icon next to the current status.  
3. Select a new status (e.g., Ongoing, Resolved, Urgent).  
4. Optionally update linked cases’ status.  
5. Save the change.

Changing status creates an activity record to keep a history of what happened and why.
