# what is civigrant?

CiviGrant is an extension for CiviCRM that helps organizations manage the process of distributing funds to other entities, such as foundations or grant recipients. It supports the grant application process by tracking the amount applied for, the amount received, and any necessary reports.

### Key Features of CiviGrant

- **Grant Application Process**: CiviGrant supports complex grant application processes with multiple pathways.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: It can be used in conjunction with CiviCase for more complex workflows.
- **Tracking and Reporting**: CiviGrant allows organizations to manage and report on grants effectively.

### Example Use Case

Consider Wookie Hole Community Action, a small organization that distributes funds to support local events. They use CiviGrant to manage applications, track funding, and solicit feedback from recipients.

### How CiviGrant Differs from CiviContribute

CiviContribute is used to track money coming into an organization, while CiviGrant tracks money going out. This distinction is crucial for organizations managing both incoming and outgoing funds.
