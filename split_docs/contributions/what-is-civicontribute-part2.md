# How to enter contributions manually

## Overview

Sometimes you need to add a contribution payment manually, such as cash or check donations received in person. This guide walks you through entering these contributions in CiviCRM.

## Steps to enter a contribution

1. Go to the **Contributions** menu and select **New Contribution**.  
2. Search for or create the contact who made the contribution.  
3. Enter the contribution details:  
   - Amount  
   - Contribution type (donation, membership, event fee, etc.)  
   - Payment method (cash, check, credit card, etc.)  
   - Date of payment  
4. Save the contribution record.  
5. Optionally, generate a receipt or thank-you letter to send to the donor.

## Tips

- Use batches to enter multiple contributions at once for faster processing.  
- Tag contributions to link them to specific campaigns or events for easier reporting.  
- Keep notes on contributions if needed for internal tracking.

This process helps keep your financial records accurate and up to date.
