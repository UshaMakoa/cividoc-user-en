# Reports and analysis

## Understanding reports in CiviCRM

CiviCRM includes a variety of reports designed to help you analyze your contributions and fundraising efforts. These reports give you insights into who is donating, how much, and trends over time, helping your organization make informed decisions.

## Contribution reports overview

Out of the box, CiviCRM provides **thirteen different Contribution Reports**. Each report focuses on a specific way to look at your donation data:

- **Contribution Summary Report**: Groups contributions by different criteria like donor, time period, or campaign. This report shows summary statistics and links to a detailed report for more information.

- **Contribution Detail Report**: Shows detailed information about specific contributions, useful for understanding individual donations or subsets of data.

- **Repeat Contribution Report**: Compares total donations from contacts across two time periods, highlighting increases or decreases in giving.

- **SYBUNT and LYBUNT Reports**: Help identify donors who gave in some past years but not the current year, useful for donor retention efforts.

- **Contribution by Household and Organization Reports**: Aggregate donations by family or organization, helping you see collective giving patterns.

- **Top Donors Report**: Lists your highest donors in a given period, which can be customized to show as many as you want.

- **Personal Campaign Page Report**: Provides an overview of fundraising pages created by individuals, filtered by campaign or other criteria.

- **Soft Credit Report**: Shows donations credited to people who helped secure the gift but are not the primary donor.

- **Contribution Aggregate by Relationship Report**: Groups a contact’s donations by year and includes contributions from related contacts.

- **Recurring Contributions Report**: Details the status of ongoing, repeated donations.

- **Bookkeeping Transactions Report**: Lists all payment transactions with financial details like transaction number and payment method.

## Using reports effectively

These reports help you answer questions such as:

- Which campaigns bring in the most donations?  
- How are donations trending over time?  
- Who are your top donors?  
- Are donors increasing or decreasing their support?  
- How do donations from families or organizations add up?

## Beyond the standard reports

If the built-in reports don’t meet all your needs, you can:

- **Install additional report extensions** from the CiviCRM community to access more specialized reports.  
- **Request or commission custom reports or searches** tailored to your organization’s unique requirements.  
- Consider contributing custom reports back to the community to help others.

## Getting started

To begin exploring reports:

1. Navigate to the **Reports** section in your CiviCRM dashboard.  
2. Select the report that matches your current question or task.  
3. Use filters to narrow down the data by date, campaign, donor type, or other criteria.  
4. Review the summary and detailed data to gain insights.  
5. Export reports if you want to share or analyze data outside CiviCRM.
