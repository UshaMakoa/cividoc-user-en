# Contribution reports explained

## Contribution summary and detail reports

The **Contribution Summary Report** lets you group donations by different categories such as donor, date, or campaign. Clicking on any summary row opens the **Contribution Detail Report**, which shows individual donation records for that group.

Use these reports to see where most of your income comes from and to spot trends in your fundraising activities.

## Repeat contribution report

This report compares donations from your contacts between two time periods. It shows who has increased their giving and who has decreased, helping you focus your donor engagement efforts.

## SYBUNT and LYBUNT reports

- **SYBUNT**: Donors who gave in some years but not the current year.  
- **LYBUNT**: Donors who gave last year but not this year.

These reports help identify donors who might need a reminder or re-engagement.

## Household and organization contribution reports

If your organization tracks donations by families or companies, these reports aggregate contributions accordingly. This gives a broader picture of giving beyond individual donors.

## Top donors report

See a ranked list of your highest donors for any time period. You can adjust how many donors to show, helping you recognize and thank your most generous supporters.

## Personal campaign page report

Track the progress of individual fundraising pages created by supporters. Filter by campaign or other criteria to manage and support your fundraisers.

## Soft credit report

Soft credits recognize people who helped secure a donation but are not the primary donor. This report helps you acknowledge those supporters properly.

## Recurring contributions report

Monitor the status of ongoing donations set up to repeat automatically, ensuring you keep track of these important funding streams.

## Bookkeeping transactions report

Provides detailed financial transaction information, useful for accounting and auditing purposes.
