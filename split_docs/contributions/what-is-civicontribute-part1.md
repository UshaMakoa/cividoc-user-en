# What is CiviContribute?

## Introduction

CiviContribute is a part of CiviCRM that helps your organization **record and manage financial and in-kind contributions**. This includes donations, membership payments, event fees, and fundraising campaigns.

## What can CiviContribute do?

- Accept donations and other types of financial or in-kind contributions  
- Process membership signups and renewals  
- Handle event fee payments  
- Manage fundraising campaigns  
- Allow supporters to create personal fundraising pages  
- Enter payments quickly in batches  
- Export financial transactions for accounting  
- Generate reports to track fundraising results and trends  

In CiviCRM, a *contribution* means any payment or financial transaction, such as a donation, event fee, or membership fee. It also includes in-kind contributions.

## Example scenario: Arts in Action workshops

Imagine a community arts group called *Arts in Action* that runs leadership workshops for youth. They use CiviContribute together with CiviEvent to manage workshop fees and donations efficiently.

- Workshops are funded by participant fees, local grants, and donations.  
- Donations are collected through email campaigns with links to online donation pages.  
- Donors receive automatic thank-you emails and receipts.  
- Participants register and pay online, choosing optional add-ons like food or lodging.  
- New participants are added to the database automatically.  
- Some participants pay later in cash, and payments are recorded manually during the event.  
- Participants can share the registration link with friends to encourage more sign-ups.  
- After each workshop, staff run reports showing income sources and donor information.  
- Key fundraising statistics are displayed on staff dashboards for easy monitoring.

This example shows how CiviContribute supports diverse payment methods and helps track contributions clearly.
