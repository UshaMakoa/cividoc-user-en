# Setting up thank-you gifts (premiums) for donors

## Overview

Thank-you gifts, or premiums, are items or services—like T-shirts, subscriptions, or memberships—that you can offer to donors as a token of appreciation when they make a contribution. This guide walks you through the process of adding and managing premiums in CiviCRM, so you can easily offer incentives to your supporters.

## How to add a premium

1. **Go to the premiums section**  
   In your CiviCRM site, navigate to **Administer > CiviContribute > Premiums (Thank-You Gifts)**.
2. **Add a new premium**  
   Click **Add Premium** to create a new thank-you gift, or **Edit** to update an existing one.
3. **Enter details about the premium**  
   Fill in the following information:
   - **Name**: A clear name for the premium (e.g., “2025 Supporter T-Shirt”).
   - **Description**: A brief description to help donors understand what they’re receiving.
   - **SKU**: An optional product code for tracking.
   - **Premium Image**: Upload an image so donors can see the item.
   - **Minimum Contribution Amount**: Set the minimum donation required to receive this premium.
   - **Market Value**: The fair market value of the item (important for tax receipts).
   - **Actual Cost**: The cost to your organization (optional).
   - **Financial Type**: Assign a financial type if needed for your accounting.
   - **Options**: Add details like available colors or sizes, if applicable.
4. **Set up subscriptions or services (if needed)**  
   If your premium is a subscription or service (like a monthly newsletter), click **Subscription or Service Settings** to define:
   - **Period Type**: Choose between Fixed (specific dates) or Rolling (starts when the donor signs up).
   - **Fixed Period Start Day**: If using a fixed period, set the start date.
   - **Duration**: How long the subscription or service lasts.
   - **Frequency**: How often it renews (e.g., monthly, annually).

## Tips for success

- **Keep it simple**: Start with one or two premiums to see what resonates with your donors.
- **Be clear**: Make sure the description and image help donors understand exactly what they’ll receive.
- **Review regularly**: Check that your premiums are still relevant and update them as needed.

## Next steps

Once your premiums are set up, they will appear as options on your contribution pages. Donors can select their preferred thank-you gift when making a donation. You can always come back to add, edit, or remove premiums as your needs change.
