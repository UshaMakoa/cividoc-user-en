# Managing subscription and service premiums

## Overview

If your organization offers ongoing benefits—like a monthly newsletter or annual membership—as thank-you gifts, you can set these up as subscription or service premiums in CiviCRM. This guide explains how to configure these options so your donors receive the right benefits at the right time.

## How to set up a subscription or service premium

1. **Add or edit a premium**  
   Follow the steps in the previous guide to create a new premium or edit an existing one.
2. **Access subscription/service settings**  
   Click **Subscription or Service Settings** within the premium setup form.
3. **Choose the period type**  
   Select **Fixed Period** if the subscription starts on a specific date (e.g., all memberships begin January 1).  
   Select **Rolling Period** if the subscription starts when the donor signs up (e.g., a 12-month newsletter subscription starting from the donation date).
4. **Set the start day (fixed period only)**  
   If you chose Fixed Period, specify the day the subscription begins.
5. **Define the duration**  
   Enter how long the subscription or service lasts (e.g., 12 months).
6. **Set the frequency**  
   Choose how often the subscription renews (e.g., monthly, annually).

## Tips for managing subscriptions

- **Communicate clearly**: Let donors know when their subscription starts and how long it lasts.
- **Keep records**: Use the SKU and description fields to track different subscription types.
- **Review regularly**: Check that subscriptions are renewing as expected and update settings if your offerings change.

## Next steps

Once set up, donors who select a subscription or service premium will automatically be enrolled for the duration you specified. You can always adjust these settings as your programs evolve.

Each page is focused, uses plain English, and avoids mixing documentation types, in line with Diátaxis best practices[1][5]. If your team needs even more detailed instructions (for example, troubleshooting or advanced configurations), consider breaking those out into separate, clearly labeled guides.
