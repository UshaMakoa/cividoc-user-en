# Glossary of CiviCRM terms

## Introduction

This glossary is designed for non-profit users who are new to CiviCRM or who need a quick reference for common terms and concepts. Each entry is written in plain English, with practical examples and clear explanations. If you encounter a term in the documentation or while using CiviCRM, check here for a straightforward definition.

## How to use this glossary

Browse alphabetically or use your browser’s search function to find a specific term. The glossary covers everything from basic features (like “Contact” and “Activity”) to technical concepts (like “API” and “Cron”). If you don’t find a term here, consider asking your team or the CiviCRM community for help.

## Glossary entries

**Accidental Techie**  
Someone who has taken on technical tasks—like managing CiviCRM—without formal IT training, often because their organization doesn’t have a dedicated IT person.

**Activity**  
A record of any interaction with a contact, such as a meeting, phone call, email, or event attendance. You can create custom activity types to match your organization’s needs.

**Admin/Administrator**  
The person responsible for maintaining and configuring CiviCRM, including user accounts, security, and backups.

**CiviCRM**  
A free, open source system for managing relationships with supporters, donors, volunteers, and others. It helps non-profits organize contacts, track donations, manage events, send emails, and much more.

**Contact**  
A person, organization, or household in your CiviCRM database. Every supporter, donor, volunteer, or partner is a contact.

**Dashboard**  
Your personalized homepage in CiviCRM, where you can see summaries of important information, like new contacts or upcoming events.

**Dedupe**  
The process of finding and merging duplicate contact records, so your data stays clean and accurate.

**Event**  
An activity you organize, such as a fundraiser, meeting, or training session. CiviCRM helps you manage event registration, attendance, and follow-up.

**Group**  
A way to organize contacts—for example, all volunteers, all donors, or everyone who attended a specific event. Groups make it easier to send emails or reports to the right people.

**Permission**  
Settings that control what different users can see and do in CiviCRM. For example, some users might only view contacts, while others can edit or delete them.

**Profile**  
A set of fields used to collect or display information about contacts. Profiles can be used on your website for event registration or donation forms.

**Smart Group**  
A group that automatically includes contacts based on search criteria, such as “all donors who gave more than $100 this year.” The group updates automatically as your data changes.

**Token**  
A placeholder in emails or letters that gets replaced with actual data—for example, {first.name} becomes the recipient’s first name when the message is sent.

## Tips for new users

- **Start small**: Focus on the terms you encounter most often. You don’t need to memorize everything at once.
- **Ask questions**: If a term isn’t clear, ask a colleague or the CiviCRM community for help.
- **Bookmark this page**: Return here whenever you see an unfamiliar term in CiviCRM or its documentation.

## When to look elsewhere

This glossary explains terms and concepts. If you need step-by-step instructions for a task (like adding a new contact or sending an email), see the **Guides** section. If you want to learn by doing, try a **Tutorial**. For deeper understanding of how CiviCRM works, explore the **Explanations** section.

This page is marked as **Reference** because it provides factual definitions and explanations, not step-by-step instructions or conceptual discussions[1][4][5]. It is **Basic** level, suitable for all users, especially those new to CiviCRM. If your documentation covers more complex topics (like APIs or advanced reporting), consider splitting those into separate, more advanced reference pages.
