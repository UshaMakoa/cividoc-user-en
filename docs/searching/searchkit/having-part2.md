# Creating Your First Search with a Having Filter

## Getting Started

Let’s walk through creating a simple search in CiviCRM Search Kit and using the **Having** filter to refine your results. This tutorial assumes you’re new to Search Kit but have basic CiviCRM access.

## Step 1: Open Search Kit

From your CiviCRM menu, go to **Search Kit** and click **New Search**.

## Step 2: Choose Your Entity

Select the main type of record you want to search—for example, **Contacts** or **Contributions**.

## Step 3: Add Fields to Your Results

Pick the fields you want to see in your results table. For example, you might choose **Display Name**, **Email**, and **Total Contributions**.

## Step 4: Apply a Having Filter

1. Click the **Filter Conditions** tab.
2. Select **Having** (not Where).
3. Choose a field from your results—for example, **Total Contributions**.
4. Set the operator to “greater than” and enter a value (like 5) to see only contacts who have donated more than five times.
5. Click **Apply**.

## Step 5: Review and Save

Check your results to make sure they match what you expected. If everything looks good, you can save your search for later use.

## Congratulations!

You’ve just created your first search with a **Having** filter. This is a great way to focus on the data that matters most to your team. As you get more comfortable, try adding more fields or experimenting with different operators.
