# managing expiration dates in civicrm

## what are expiration dates?
Expiration dates in CiviCRM are used to manage searches that are only useful for a defined period. This feature helps keep your saved searches organized by automatically hiding them after a set date.

## setting an expiration date
To set an expiration date for a search, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Search Settings**: Go to the search settings page where you can manage your saved searches.
2. **Select the Search**: Choose the search you want to set an expiration date for.
3. **Set the Expiration Date**: Enter the date when you want the search to expire. After this date, the search will be hidden from view but not deleted.

## restoring expired searches
If you need to access a search after its expiration date, you can restore it by removing the expiration date. This can be done via the API explorer or SQL statement.

### tips for using expiration dates
- **Plan Ahead**: Set expiration dates for searches that are time-sensitive to keep your list organized.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your searches to ensure they remain relevant.

If the content seems too complex or could be simplified further, consider splitting it into multiple pages based on simpler or more complex subjects. For example, one page could focus on setting expiration dates, while another could delve into restoring expired searches or advanced management techniques.
