# Search for

## What is "Search For"?

The **Search For** feature in CiviCRM's Search Kit lets you choose the main type of information (called an *entity*) you want to find in your database. This could be contacts, activities, contributions, events, or other types of records.

## Why use Search For?

Using **Search For** helps you focus your search on the right kind of data. For example, if you want to find people who attended an event, you would select "Participants." If you want to find donations, you would select "Contributions."

## How to choose an entity

Here are some common entities you can search for:

- **Activity**: Actions related to contacts, like phone calls or meetings.
- **Contacts**: People, organizations, or households in your database.
- **Contributions**: Donations or financial transactions.
- **Events**: Scheduled activities people can register for.
- **Grants**: Funds given or applied for.
- **Individuals**: Contacts who are people.
- **Memberships**: Records of people or organizations who belong to your membership program.
- **Organizations**: Contacts that are organizations.
- **Participants**: Records of people attending events.
- **Pledges**: Promises to give money in the future.

There are also many other less common entities available if you need them.

## What happens after selecting an entity?

Once you pick your main entity, you can add extra details or filters to narrow your search. For example, you might want to find contacts who have made contributions or participants who attended a specific event.

## Tips for beginners

- Start by choosing the entity that best matches what you want to find.
- Use simple filters first to get comfortable with the search process.
- Remember, you can always adjust your search to be broader or more specific.

This feature is designed to help you find the right information quickly, even if you are new to CiviCRM.
