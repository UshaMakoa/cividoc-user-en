# Using Actions in CiviCRM Search Kit

## What are Actions?

Actions are options available in CiviCRM’s Search Kit that let you do things with your search results—like update records, send emails, or export data. The actions you see depend on what kind of data you’re searching for, such as contacts, contributions, or events.

## How to Use Actions

After you run a search, you’ll see an Actions menu. To use most actions, you need to select one or more results from your search. If you don’t select anything, only the “Download Spreadsheet” option will be available.

- **Selecting results:** Click the checkbox next to each item you want to work with, or use the dark gray box at the top to select all results on the page.
- **Actions menu:** Click the Actions button to see what you can do with your selected results. The options change based on the type of data you’re viewing.
- **Common actions:** These might include exporting data, updating fields, sending emails, or adding tags. The exact options depend on your CiviCRM setup and permissions.

## Tips for Nonprofits

- **Start small:** Try selecting a few contacts and explore the Actions menu to see what’s possible.
- **Experiment safely:** If you’re unsure, test actions with a small group or in a training environment first.
- **Ask for help:** If an action doesn’t do what you expect, check with your team or the CiviCRM community.

## Next Steps

Once you’re comfortable with basic actions, you can explore more advanced options, like creating custom searches or automating workflows. Remember, you can always revisit this guide as you learn more about CiviCRM.
