# Understanding soft credits in CiviCRM

## What is a soft credit?

A soft credit is a way to give credit to someone who helped bring in a donation, even if they didn’t make the donation themselves. For example, if a volunteer asks their network to donate to your cause, those donations can be “soft credited” to the volunteer. This helps you track and thank everyone who contributes to your fundraising success.

## Why use soft credits?

- **Recognize supporters**: Thank volunteers, board members, or community leaders who help raise funds.
- **Measure impact**: See who your most effective fundraisers are.
- **Strengthen relationships**: Build stronger connections with everyone involved in your fundraising efforts.

## How do soft credits work?

When a donation is made, you can assign a soft credit to one or more contacts in CiviCRM. The original donor still gets credit for the gift, but the soft credit contact is also recognized. You can report on soft credits separately or alongside regular donations.

## Common uses

- **Peer-to-peer fundraising**: Track gifts raised by individual fundraisers.
- **Matching gifts**: Recognize companies that match employee donations.
- **In memoriam or tribute gifts**: Acknowledge the person being honored.

## Getting started

Soft credits are managed in the **Contributions** section of CiviCRM. You can add them when entering a donation manually or through online forms. For advanced reporting, use **Search Kit** to create custom searches and displays, as shown in the previous guide.
