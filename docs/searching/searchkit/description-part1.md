# Description

## What is a saved search description?

A saved search description is a detailed explanation you add to a saved search in CiviCRM. It helps you and others understand what the search does, especially when the title alone is not enough to explain its full purpose.

## Why add a description?

Adding a clear description to your saved search makes it easier to remember or share what the search is for. This is especially helpful when you have many saved searches or when others need to use or modify your searches.

## How to write a good description

- Use simple language to explain what the search looks for or filters.
- Mention any important details about the search criteria or the results it produces.
- Keep it concise but informative enough to capture the searchâ€™s scope.

## Where to add the description

When saving or editing a search in CiviCRM, look for the **Description** field. Enter your detailed explanation there before saving the search.

## Tips for non-expert users

- Think about what you would want to know if you found this search later.
- Avoid technical jargon; use everyday words.
- Update the description if you change the search criteria.

This explanation helps non-profit users new to CiviCRM understand how to document their saved searches clearly, making their work more organized and accessible.
