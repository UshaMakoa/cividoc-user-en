# Understanding packaged and custom saved searches

## Packaged searches

These are ready-made searches included with SearchKit or installed extensions. They come with predefined entities and columns, so you can start using them immediately. You can modify or clone packaged searches to fit your needs.

## Custom searches

These are searches you build yourself from scratch. You select the entity, add fields, filters, and configure the search exactly how you want. Saving custom searches lets you reuse your specific queries easily.
