# Creating Your First Search in CiviCRM Search Kit

## Getting Started

This tutorial walks you through creating a simple search, so you can quickly find groups of contacts, events, or contributions that matter to your non-profit.

## Step 1: Open Search Kit

Log in to CiviCRM and navigate to the Search Kit section.

## Step 2: Start a New Search

Click “New Search” and choose the type of data you want to search (for example, Contacts, Contributions, or Events).

## Step 3: Set Your Search Criteria

Use the filters to narrow down your results. For example, you might search for all contacts in a specific city or all donations over a certain amount.

## Step 4: Save Your Search

Once you’re happy with your results, click “Save.” Give your search a clear, descriptive title so you and your team can find it later.

## Step 5: Find and Use Your Saved Search

Your saved search will appear in the Saved Searches list. You can run it again anytime, or share it with colleagues.
