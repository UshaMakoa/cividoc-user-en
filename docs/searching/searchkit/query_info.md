# Query info

## What is query info?

Query info shows you the underlying code—both API and SQL—that powers your search in Search Kit. This feature is optional and intended for users who want to copy or reuse these queries outside of Search Kit, such as in custom reports or integrations. If you are comfortable with technical details, query info can help you understand exactly how your search works and how to use it elsewhere.

## Description

When you view query info for a search, you will see:

- **API code**: The exact API call that Search Kit uses to run your search. This can be copied and used in other parts of CiviCRM, such as custom scripts or extensions.
- **SQL code**: The actual SQL query that retrieves your data from the database. This is useful if you need to run advanced searches directly in your database or troubleshoot search results.

You do not need to use query info for everyday tasks, but it is useful if you want more control over your data or need to share your search setup with technical colleagues.

## Option details

Depending on your search, query info may include several options:

- **API parameters**: These are the settings that define what data is retrieved, such as which fields to search, filters applied, and sorting order.
- **SQL clauses**: These show how your search criteria are translated into database language, including SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses.
- **Variable options**: If your search uses dropdowns or lists with many options, query info will show how each choice affects the final query.

If the list of options is very long, focus on the main choices that affect your results, such as filters and fields selected.
