# Using Query info for troubleshooting

## When to use Query info for troubleshooting

If your search results are unexpected or incomplete, Query Info can help you:

- Verify that the filters you set are correctly translated into the query.  
- Identify if joins or conditions in the SQL are causing missing data.  
- Share the query with support or developers for assistance.

## Tips for troubleshooting

- Compare the API and SQL queries to your intended search logic.  
- Look for missing or extra conditions that might affect results.  
- Test the SQL query directly in your database if you have access.  
- Use the API query in a test environment to confirm behavior.
