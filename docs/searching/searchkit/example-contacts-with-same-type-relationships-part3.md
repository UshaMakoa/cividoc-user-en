# Adding and counting relationships in a search

## What you’ll learn

In this tutorial, you’ll add relationship information to your search and learn how to count how many times a relationship type appears for each contact.

## Step by step

1. **Start a new search** as in the previous tutorial.
2. **Click +Add** and select **Contact Related Contacts: Relationship**.
3. **Go to Field Transformations** and choose **Count** for the Relationship field.
4. **Click Search** to see how many relationships each contact has.

Now you can see which contacts have relationships and how many. This skill is useful for many non-profit tasks, like identifying families or tracking connections between people.
