# Export and import saved searches in SearchKit

## Exporting a saved search

You can export any saved SearchKit search to share it with colleagues or use it on another CiviCRM site. This process does not require coding skills—just follow these steps:

- Save your SearchKit query first.

- Go to the main SearchKit page.

- Find your saved search and click the “Export” option in the actions menu (☰) next to it.

- A window will appear showing a coded version of your search.

- Click the button to copy the search to your clipboard.

- If you have created displays, groups, or forms related to your search, you can include them in the export.

- If you want to add the search to a custom extension, use the “API Explorer Export” link at the top of the export window.

Once copied, you can save the exported search to a file, send it to someone else, or import it into another CiviCRM site.

## Importing a saved search

To import a SearchKit search someone has shared with you:

- Go to the main SearchKit page.

- Click the “Import” link just below the “New Search” button in the top right corner.

- A window will open with an empty box.

- Paste the exported search code into the box and submit.

- You’ll be returned to the main screen, where you’ll see your newly imported search ready to use.

This page is a Guide because it provides step
-by-step instructions for a specific task (exporting and importing searches), not a hands-on tutorial or reference. It is Basic level, as it requires no technical expertise and is aimed at new users. The section is Searching and reporting > SearchKit > Export and Import. If the page included detailed options or background on SearchKit architecture, those could be split into Reference or Explanation pages. -->
