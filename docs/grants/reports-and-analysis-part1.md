# Reports and analysis

## Understanding grants and contacts in CiviCRM

In CiviCRM, it’s important to know that **contacts** (people or organizations) and **grants** (funding awards) are treated separately. When searching or reporting, ask yourself: *Do I want information about the grants themselves, or about the contacts related to those grants?* For example:

- To find which contacts received grants in a certain year, you search by contacts.  
- To find how many grant applications were submitted for a program, you search by grants.

This helps you choose the right search tool and get the data you need.

## Searching for grant data

CiviCRM offers two main ways to search for grant information:

- **Find Grants search form:** Use this to search based on grant-specific details and get a list of grants. This is best when you want to work with grants as records.  
- **Advanced search (Grants tab):** Use this to search grants combined with contact information and get a list of contacts matching your criteria.

Both searches can provide simple totals and let you export the results as a CSV file for further analysis in spreadsheet software.

## Using grant reports

CiviCRM includes a built-in **Grant report** that shows details about grants of a particular type. This report also summarizes key statistics like the total amounts requested and granted, giving you a quick overview of your grant activity.

## Getting more detailed analysis

If the built-in searches and reports don’t meet your needs, you can:

- Ask your technical team or a CiviCRM expert to create a **custom report** or **custom search** tailored to your specific questions.  
- Explore the **CiviReport** section in the documentation for more options on creating and managing reports.
