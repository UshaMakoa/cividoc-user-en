# Reports and analysis

## Overview

You can use several techniques in CiviCRM to report on and analyze your organisation’s grants. The **grant dashboard** gives you a quick overview of your grant types. For more detailed information, you can use:

- The **Find Grants** search form

- The **Grants** tab in advanced search

- The **Grant report**

## Searching for grant data

CiviCRM treats **contacts** (people or organizations) and **grants** (funding applications) as separate types of records. When searching, think about whether you want to focus on the grant itself or the contact who applied:

- If you want to answer questions about grants (for example, “How many grant applications did we receive this year?”), use the **Find Grants** search.

- If you want to answer questions about contacts (for example, “Which contacts were successful grant applicants in 2011?”), use the **Advanced Search** and include grant criteria.

Both search options allow you to:

- Filter results based on grant or contact information

- View simple totals

- Export results as a CSV file for further analysis

## Grant reports

CiviCRM includes a built
-in report for grants. You can use this report to:

- Show details for all grants of a particular type

- View aggregated statistics at the bottom, such as the total amounts requested and granted

## More analysis

If the built
-in reports or searches do not meet your needs, you can:

- Commission a new custom report or search

- Explore the CiviReport section for more information about creating custom reports

This page is best categorized as a "Guide" because it helps users achieve specific goals (finding, reporting, and analyzing grants) with actionable steps, but does not provide step
-by-step instructions (tutorial), exhaustive technical details (reference), or background theory (explanation). The content is suitable for users new to CiviCRM’s grant reporting features, so the level is Basic. The logical section is "Grants > Reports and analysis". -->
