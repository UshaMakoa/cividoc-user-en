# What you need to know about CiviGrant

## Introduction to CiviGrant

CiviGrant is a tool within CiviCRM designed to help organizations that give grants manage the entire grant process. It is one of the simpler components of CiviCRM, so if you have experience with other parts of CiviCRM, you will likely find CiviGrant straightforward to use.

## Key concepts

Understanding these basic ideas will help you use CiviGrant effectively:

### CiviGrant workflow

The usual process starts when a contact applies for a grant. You record details such as the amount requested and the application date. Then you track each stage of the grant process, including:

- When the decision was made  
- How much money was granted  
- When funds were transferred  
- When the grant report is due and if it has been received  

### Grant types

Grant types let you categorize the different kinds of grants your organization offers. You can create as many grant types as you need and search for grants by type.

### Grant statuses

CiviGrant comes with three default statuses:

- Pending  
- Granted  
- Rejected  

You can add more statuses to match your specific workflow.

### Application forms and eligibility criteria

You can build application forms and set eligibility criteria using CiviCRM’s custom data fields. Consider which fields should be linked to the contact applying and which should be linked to the grant itself.

## Key questions to consider before you start

Before using CiviGrant, think about:

- What grant types does your organization offer?  
- What is your grant application workflow, and how does it map to CiviGrant statuses?  
- Do you have an application form, and how can you model it with custom data?  
- What reports do you want to generate from the grant process?  

Answering these questions will help you set up and use CiviGrant to fit your organization’s needs.
