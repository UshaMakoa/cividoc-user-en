# Everyday tasks

## CiviGrant dashboard

To start managing your grants, go to **Other > Grants > Dashboard** in CiviCRM. This dashboard gives you a quick overview of all grants in your system, grouped by grant type, and shows recent grant recipients. It helps you keep track of your grants in one place.

## Viewing grants

You can view grants in two main ways:

- From the **Grants dashboard**, which shows the status of all grants and recent activity.
- From an individual contact’s record, by clicking the **Grants** tab to see grants associated with that person.

## Adding and editing grant recipients

When you have selected grant recipients, you can add or update their grant records:

1. Go to **Other > Grants > New Grant**.
2. Choose an existing contact or create a new contact to assign the grant.
3. Fill in the grant details. Include as much information as you can, but you can always update this later.
4. Click **Save**.

To edit a grant later, use the **edit** link in the grant record.

## Recording reports from grant recipients

When you receive reports from grant recipients, update the grant record to reflect this:

- Open the grant record from the dashboard or contact’s Grants tab.
- Check the box labeled **Grant Report Received?**
- Add any notes or comments related to the report.
- Save your changes.

This helps you keep track of which grants have received reports and any important information related to them.
