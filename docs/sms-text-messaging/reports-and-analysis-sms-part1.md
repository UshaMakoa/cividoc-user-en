# Reports and analysis (SMS)

## Introduction

This guide helps you understand how to generate reports on all text message activity recorded in CiviCRM. Reporting on SMS activity lets you see who received messages, when, and the status of those messages.

## Accessing SMS reports

To view SMS reports:

- Go to the main menu and select **Reports**.
- Choose **Contact Reports** from the list.

This will open the Activities report, which includes SMS-related activities.

## Types of SMS activities you can report on

CiviCRM records three types of SMS activities:

- **Inbound SMS**: Messages received from contacts.
- **Mass SMS**: Bulk messages sent to groups.
- **SMS delivery**: Status updates about message sending (e.g., delivered, failed).

## Filtering your SMS report

You can narrow down your report results by applying filters:

- **SMS activity type**: Choose one or more of the activity types listed above.
- **Message status**: For example, filter by completed or scheduled messages.
- **Date and time**: Select a specific period to view messages sent or received.
- **Groups or tags**: Limit the report to contacts in certain groups or with specific tags.
- **Recipient details**: Filter by characteristics such as contact name or location.

After setting your filters, click **Preview Report** at the bottom of the filter panel to update the results.

## Tips for using SMS reports

- Use these reports to track your outreach efforts and engagement through text messaging.
- Regularly review message statuses to identify any delivery issues.
