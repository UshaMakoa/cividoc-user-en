# Creating and managing a case in CiviCase

## Step 1: Create a new case

- Go to the CiviCase section in your CiviCRM dashboard.
- Click “Add Case.”
- Choose the case type that matches the work you want to track.
- Select the client contact for the case.
- Fill in any required fields and save.

## Step 2: Add activities to the case

- Open the case you just created.
- Click “Add Activity.”
- Choose the activity type (e.g., Phone Call, Meeting).
- Enter details like date, time, subject, and description.
- Assign the activity to a staff member if needed.
- Save the activity.

## Step 3: Assign roles to people involved

- In the case view, find the section for case roles.
- Add people who are involved and assign them roles like Case Coordinator or Counselor.
- This helps clarify who is responsible for what.

## Step 4: Use timelines or sequences (optional)

- If your case type has a timeline, you will see scheduled activities.
- Follow the timeline to complete activities in order.
- If using sequences, complete each activity to unlock the next.

## Step 5: Track progress and update the case

- Mark activities as completed when done.
- Add notes or new activities as needed.
- Use the case dashboard to see all your cases and their status.
