# Finding and viewing memberships

## Use the membership dashboard

The membership dashboard gives you a quick overview of your organisation’s recent memberships.

- Go to **Memberships > Dashboard**.

- You’ll see two main sections: one summarising recent memberships by type and date, and another listing recent member activity.

- All numbers in the summary are clickable. Click a number to see the list of members for that category (for example, those who joined or renewed recently).

- From these lists, you can take actions such as **Delete**, **Edit**, **Export**, or **Send Email to Contacts**.

## View a contact’s membership records

To see memberships for a specific person or organisation:

- Search for and open the contact’s record.

- Click the **Membership** tab.

    - *Note:* Memberships with a “pending” status will appear in the list but are not counted in the tab’s total number.

- The list shows active memberships first, followed by expired or cancelled ones.

- You can **edit**, **renew**, or **create** new memberships from here.

- If your CiviCRM is set up for online payments, you’ll see options to handle memberships with or without processing a real
-time credit card payment (including auto-renew if supported).

If the membership type allows inherited memberships (for example, employees of a member organisation):

- You’ll see a list of contacts who have inherited the membership.

- Up to two inherited memberships are allowed for employees.

- To reassign an inherited membership, click **Delete** next to the contact to free up a slot, then select **Create** to assign it to the correct person.

## Send email to members

To email members based on search results and personalise messages:

- Go to **Memberships > Find Members**.

- Enter your search criteria and click **Search**.

- On the results screen, select the members you want to email.

- In the **
-actions-** dropdown, choose **Send Email to Contacts**.

## Search based on membership data

CiviCRM lets you search for memberships in different ways, depending on what you need:

- **Find Members search:** Returns membership records based on your criteria.

- Go to **Memberships > Find Members**, enter your criteria, and click **Search**.

- **Advanced Search:** Lets you search using both membership and contact information and choose how results are displayed.

- Go to **Search > Advanced Search**.

- In the **Display Settings For Results** section, set **Display Results As** to **Memberships**.

- Enter your criteria and click **Search**.

After searching, you can view membership details and use the **Actions** dropdown to email or export selected members.
