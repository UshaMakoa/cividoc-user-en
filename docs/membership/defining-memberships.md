# Understanding membership types


Memberships in CiviCRM let you track who belongs to your organisation, when their membership starts and ends, and what benefits they receive.

A **membership type** is the template that defines how each kind of membership works. You’ll create one for every type of membership you offer — for example:

* *Individual Member (Annual)*

* *Student Member (Discounted)*

* *Organisation Member (Corporate)*

Each membership type describes:

* **Duration** – how long the membership lasts (for example, one year or lifetime).

* **Start and renewal rules** – whether it starts on the date someone joins or on a fixed date, and how renewals are calculated.

* **Who it applies to** – individual people, organisations, or related contacts.

* **Payment details** – whether it’s paid or free, and how payments are recorded.

Having clear membership types helps your organisation:

* Keep consistent records for reporting and renewals.

* Automate reminders and renewals.

* Offer different levels of membership without confusion.

Once these types are defined, you’ll use them in online sign-up forms, renewal pages, or when manually adding memberships in the system.
