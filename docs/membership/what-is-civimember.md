# What is CiviMember

## Overview

CiviMember is the part of CiviCRM that helps your organisation manage memberships efficiently. With CiviMember, you can:

- **Define membership types and pricing** that fit your needs.
- **Let people join or renew memberships online** using CiviContribute for payments.
- **Manually add or update memberships** through the admin area.
- **Send automatic messages** to welcome new members or remind them to renew.
- **Track and report on memberships** at every stage.
- **Provide extra website access or benefits** just for members.

CiviMember is flexible, so you can set up memberships to match your organisation’s structure—whether memberships are free or paid, last for a day or a lifetime, or have simple or complex pricing.

## How CiviMember works

- **Members are contacts**: Any person, household, or organisation in your CiviCRM database can have one or more memberships.
- **Memberships are visible**: You can see memberships on each contact’s summary screen and on the membership dashboard.
- **Easy searching and reporting**: Find memberships using search tools and create customisable reports to suit your needs.
- **Online and manual options**: Members can join or renew online, or you can manage memberships yourself in the admin area.
- **Automated reminders**: Set up scheduled emails to remind members about renewals or to welcome new members.

## Example: Membership management in action

The Atlantic Region Public Transit Association (ARPTA) needed to manage four types of memberships:

- **Regular Members**: Public transit systems, with different tiers based on size. All employees get member benefits.
- **Affiliate Members**: Businesses in the transit industry. Up to 10 employees per business get benefits.
- **Associate Members**: Individuals like students and public interest groups.
- **Honorary Members**: Retired executives and notable contributors, with free lifetime membership.

ARPTA used CiviMember to create these categories and set up online sign-up and renewal. This made it easier for new members to join and for current members to renew. Automated reminders and online payments saved time and improved member engagement. As a result, ARPTA saw a big increase in new members and better retention, while reducing admin work.

## Tips for getting started

- Review your organisation’s membership structure and think about how it fits with CiviMember’s flexible options.

- Work with your team to plan how memberships will be managed day
-to-day.

- Remember, CiviMember can handle a wide range of membership needs, so take time to explore its features.
