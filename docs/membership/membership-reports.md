# Using membership reports and dashboards

This guide explains how to use CiviCRM’s built-in reports and dashboards to track membership trends, identify renewals and lapses, and present information to your team or board.

You’ll learn which reports are most useful, how to customise them, and how to display membership data on your dashboard for quick access.

It’s aimed at staff and administrators who manage membership data and want clear insights without needing technical skills or complex reporting tools.

## **Understanding membership reports**

CiviCRM includes several standard reports that help you analyse membership information.  
 These reports draw data directly from your membership records, so they’re always up to date.

The most commonly used reports are:

* **Membership Summary Report** – gives totals by type, status, or join date.

* **Membership Detail Report** – shows a list of individual members and their membership information.

* **Membership Renewal Report** – focuses on renewals and lapses over a set period.

* **Membership Lapsed Report** – lists members whose memberships have expired or not renewed.

* **Membership by Organisation Report** – useful for organisations with group or corporate memberships.

You can run any of these reports as they are, or tailor them to your organisation’s needs.

## **Step 1: Running a standard membership report**

1. Go to **Reports → Create Reports from Templates**.

2. Scroll to the **Membership** section.

3. Choose the report type you want, such as *Membership Summary*.

4. Set filters to define what you want to see (for example, by membership type, status, or date range).

5. Click **Preview Report** to view the results.

Tip: Start with the Membership Summary Report to get a clear overview of current, lapsed, and new members.

## **Step 2: Customising your report**

You can customise any report to display exactly what you need.

1. Use the **Columns** tab to choose which fields to show (for example, contact name, start date, amount paid).

2. Use **Filters** to narrow the results — for example, only current members or only those with expired memberships in the last 60 days.

3. Use **Sorting** to order results by join date, name, or amount.

4. Add **Grouping** to summarise totals by membership type or organisation.

Once the report looks right, click **Save a Copy** so you can reuse it later.

## **Step 3: Scheduling or exporting reports**

If you need to share membership data regularly:

* Click **Export to CSV** or **PDF** to download your report.

* To send it automatically, click **Schedule Report**, set a frequency (such as monthly), and choose who should receive it.

This is ideal for monthly updates to your board or finance team without needing to run reports manually.

## **Step 4: Creating a membership dashboard**

Dashboards let you see key membership information as soon as you log in.

To add a membership report to your dashboard:

1. Open the report you want to display.

2. Click **Add to Dashboard**.

3. Choose a title and position for it on your home screen.

4. Save your changes.

You can add several reports to your dashboard — for example:

* *Current Members by Type*

* *Expiring Members in Next 30 Days*

* *Recent Renewals*

Dashboards help you monitor membership trends at a glance without needing to run reports each time.

## **Step 5: Monitoring renewals and lapses**

Use your reports to spot trends and take action:

* Track how many members renew each month.

* Identify which membership types have the most lapses.

* Review whether reminder emails are improving renewal rates.

You can combine report data with Smart Groups or Scheduled Reminders to target members who are due for renewal.

## **Best practices**

* Keep report names simple and consistent, such as “Monthly Membership Summary”.

* Schedule reports to share automatically with key staff or board members.

* Regularly review which reports you actually use — delete or archive older ones to keep your system tidy.

* Combine membership and contribution reports if you want to track income alongside renewals.

* Use dashboards as your day-to-day monitoring tool; run detailed reports only when needed.

## **What’s next**

Once you’re comfortable using reports and dashboards, you can:

* Create custom reports using **SearchKit** for more tailored insights.

* Build automated **Smart Groups** based on membership status or type.

* Use these reports to plan renewal campaigns or track membership growth over time.
