# Components

## What are components?

Components are the building blocks of CiviCRM that give you tools to manage your contacts and activities. You can use as many or as few components as you need. Turning off components you don’t use will simplify the system by hiding those features, making CiviCRM easier to navigate for your team. Don’t worry—turning off a component only hides it; it does not delete any data. When you turn it back on, your data will be there again.

You can also control who sees which components by setting permissions. For example, you might want only fundraisers to access financial information.

Each component focuses on a specific area of your nonprofit’s work. Below is a brief overview of the main components.

## CiviContribute

This component helps you manage donations and fundraising. You can track contributions, create online donation pages, and handle one-time or recurring gifts. It also includes CiviPledge, which lets you record pledges, send reminders, and allow supporters to manage their pledges online.

## CiviMail

Use CiviMail to send personalized emails and newsletters to your supporters. It’s designed to help you communicate effectively with your contacts through mass mailings.

## CiviMember

CiviMember helps you manage memberships with easy online sign-up and renewal options. It keeps track of member details and membership status.

## CiviEvent

Plan and manage events with CiviEvent. You can create event registration pages, handle paid or free events, and keep track of attendees all in one place.

## CiviReport

CiviReport offers ready-made report templates that help you understand and analyze your data. You can customize reports to get the information you need about your contacts and activities.

## CiviCampaign

This component helps you organize different activities—like events, mailings, and contributions—under one campaign. It makes it easier to track progress toward your goals.

## CiviCase

CiviCase supports case management by helping you track individual cases with timelines, dashboards, and reports. It’s useful if your organization provides services or support that require detailed follow-up.

## CiviGrant

Designed for organizations that give out grants or funds, CiviGrant helps you manage the application and distribution process.

## Next steps

Each component has its own detailed guide to help you get started and use it effectively. If you are new to CiviCRM, start with the components that match your current needs and explore others as your organization grows.
