# Introduction to CiviCRM

CiviCRM is a powerful CRM system designed specifically for non-profit organizations. It was founded in 2004 by Dave Greenberg, Donald Lobo, and Michal Mach, with early influences from Zack Rosen and Neil Drumm, who encouraged the use of Drupal as a foundational platform. This strategic decision allowed developers to leverage Drupal's functionality, focusing on building features tailored to non-profits.

## The CiviCRM Community

The CiviCRM community is diverse and vibrant, comprising the core team, non-profit users, consultants, programmers, developers, power users, volunteers, and community organizers. This community is known for its collaborative spirit and openness to new ideas. Members interact with CiviCRM in various ways, contributing to its growth and improvement.

## History of CiviCRM

CiviCRM's first version was released in 2005 with two core modules: CiviMail and CiviContribute. Over time, it has expanded to include more components and integrations with other popular CMS platforms like Backdrop, Joomla!, and WordPress. Today, CiviCRM is used by over 11,000 sites worldwide, including prominent non-profits like Amnesty International and the Wikimedia Foundation.

## Engaging with the Community

The CiviCRM community values collaboration and open communication. If you have an idea or need feedback, the best place to start is often CiviCRM's Mattermost channels, where you can engage with experienced community members. The community encourages active participation and welcomes new contributors.
