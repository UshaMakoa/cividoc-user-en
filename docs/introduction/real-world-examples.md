# Real world examples  

## Introduction  
CiviCRM is used by many different non-profit organizations around the world. Some have just a few people, while others have hundreds of staff. Their needs can be simple or quite complex. This page shares real stories of how organizations use CiviCRM to manage their work better. You will see mentions of CiviCRM features like CiviEmail, CiviMember, and CiviPledge. Don’t worry if you don’t know these yet — this is about understanding how CiviCRM can help you.  

## suffering relieved!  
The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a large peace and social justice organization with over 400 employees and many offices worldwide. Each office kept its own lists of contacts, but they used many different systems that didn’t work well together. Staff found it hard to manage contacts, send newsletters, and collect information online.  

### what they did  
AFSC started using CiviCRM with CiviMail to send emails and newsletters, CiviEvent to track event registrations, and CiviMember to manage committee members. When they found a missing feature, they worked with the CiviCRM developers to add it — a change that helped everyone using CiviCRM.  

### the results  
After switching hosting from an outside vendor to internal management, AFSC staff could fully use CiviCRM’s features. They now manage contacts, send newsletters, and handle event sign-ups easily. Nine AFSC offices use CiviCRM, and the IT department recommends it as their main database. Staff can access data anywhere, run searches, and communicate better, making their work easier and more effective.  

## a crm education  
Schoolhouse Supplies (SHS) in Portland, Oregon, collects and gives out school supplies. Before CiviCRM, they used many different software tools and hundreds of spreadsheets, which made managing data hard.  

### what they did  
SHS moved all their data into CiviCRM Standalone. They replaced several old tools with CiviCRM components for contacts, contributions, and emails. They also connected their custom online store and inventory systems to CiviCRM.  

### the results  
SHS now coordinates all their activities from one place. They are moving more manual tasks, like volunteer coordination, into CiviCRM. This helps them plan new campaigns that were too difficult before.  

## growing satisfaction  
The New York State Nursery Landscape Association (NYSNLA) supports nursery and landscape professionals. They used spreadsheets and a Microsoft Access database before moving to CiviCRM to better manage members and provide a public member directory.  

### what they did  
With help from a consultant, NYSNLA mapped their data into CiviCRM and used CiviMember, CiviEvent, CiviContribute, and CiviMail. They tracked their special Certified Nursery Landscape Professional program using membership features and event registrations. They also customized the system to quickly see certification status for employees.  

### the results  
NYSNLA created a searchable member directory on their website that always shows up-to-date information. Members can update their own details, making communication easier and more accurate.  

## campaigning for efficiency  
The Green Party of New Zealand has thousands of members and contacts. Before CiviCRM, they used many different systems for managing members, donations, and campaigns.  

### what they did  
Starting in 2007, the Green Party set up CiviCRM with Drupal. They used it for online donations, memberships, and event registrations. They created custom data fields and smart groups to manage media releases. They also developed a special access control system to meet their complex needs.  

### the results  
The Party increased online fundraising and made membership renewals easier. They continue to improve how they use CiviCRM and train staff to get the most from it.  

## quest for success  
QuestBridge helps motivated low-income high school students get into college. They built their application and communication system around CiviCRM.  

### what they did  
QuestBridge used CiviCRM to store student applications, biographical data, and communication history, extending it with custom programming.  

### the results  
In one school year, QuestBridge helped over 1200 students get accepted to partner colleges efficiently. They plan to upgrade CiviCRM and wish they had invested more in training at the start.  

## changing with the times  
The San Francisco School serves preschool to 8th grade students. Good communication with families is very important.  

### what they did  
They created a Parent Portal using CiviCRM where parents log in to see and update contact information, schedule parent-teacher conferences, and register for after-school classes. Features were introduced gradually to help everyone adjust.  

### the results  
Parents can keep their information up to date and manage schedules online. This improved communication and made school processes smoother for both families and staff.  

## summary  
These real-world stories show how CiviCRM helps non-profits manage contacts, communications, events, memberships, and more. Whether you are just starting or looking to improve your system, learning from others’ experiences can inspire you to use CiviCRM in ways that fit your organization’s needs.
