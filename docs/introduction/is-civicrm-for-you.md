# Is CiviCRM right for your organisation?

## How to decide if CiviCRM is a good fit

CiviCRM is a powerful tool designed to help non-profits manage contacts, fundraising, memberships, events, and more. However, it may not be the best choice for every organisation. Here are some ways you can find out if CiviCRM meets your needs:

- **Identify your organisation’s needs:** List what you want your software to do. Consider contact management, fundraising, event registration, reporting, and integration with your website.
- **Read real-world examples:** Look for case studies about organisations similar to yours that use CiviCRM. This helps you see how others have benefited and what challenges they faced.
- **Try a demonstration site:** Use free demo sites to explore CiviCRM’s features hands-on, without installing anything.
- **Talk to other CiviCRM users:** If you know a similar organisation using CiviCRM, ask about their experience. If not, you can reach out to the CiviCRM community online.
- **Consult with a CiviCRM expert:** Contact a professional consultant who can discuss your needs and show you how CiviCRM could work for your organisation.
- **Test CiviCRM yourself:** You can download and install a test version of CiviCRM for free, or try CiviCRM Spark, a hosted version that’s easy to set up and ideal for smaller organisations or trial use.
