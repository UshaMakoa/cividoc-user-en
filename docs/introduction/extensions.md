# Extensions  

## what are extensions?  
Extensions are add-ons that bring new features or change how CiviCRM works without affecting the whole community. They help you customize CiviCRM to better fit your organization’s needs. Many extensions are created for specific uses, while others are shared for everyone to use.  

## the extensions directory  
The extensions directory is a collection of extensions made by the CiviCRM community. It shows popular extensions that you can download and use. Extensions are grouped into two types:  
- Native extensions that work with any website system (CMS)  
- CMS-specific extensions that connect CiviCRM to your website platform, like Drupal or WordPress  

## how to install extensions  
You can add extensions directly inside CiviCRM if your system is set up for it. To do this, go to:  
Administer > System Settings > Extensions  
Here, you’ll see a list of extensions that work with your version of CiviCRM. If you don’t see any extensions, your system might need extra setup — ask your system administrator for help.  

## writing your own extensions  
If you have special needs, you can create your own extension or hire a developer to do it. Writing extensions requires coding skills, so it’s more advanced. If your extension could help others, consider sharing it with the community. Sharing your work can bring helpful feedback and improvements.  

## next steps  
Explore the extensions directory to find tools that make your work easier. Installing extensions can help your non-profit do more with CiviCRM without needing to be an expert.
