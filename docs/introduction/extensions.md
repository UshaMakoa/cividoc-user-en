# Extensions in civicrm

## What are extensions?
Extensions in CiviCRM are additional modules that enhance the core functionality of the system. They allow users to add new features or modify existing ones to better suit their specific needs. Extensions can be developed for individual use cases or shared with the broader CiviCRM community by publishing them in the extensions directory.

## Types of extensions
Extensions are categorized into two main types:
- **Native Extensions**: These work with any Content Management System (CMS) and provide general functionality enhancements.
- **CMS-Specific Extensions**: These are tailored to integrate CiviCRM with specific CMS platforms like Drupal or WordPress, often referred to by different names (e.g., Drupal Modules or WordPress Plugins).

## Using extensions
To use extensions, you can install them directly from within CiviCRM if your system is properly configured. The extensions directory lists available extensions, which are ranked by popularity based on the number of sites using them.

## Writing and publishing extensions
Developers can create custom extensions to meet specific organizational needs. Publishing these extensions can provide valuable feedback and contributions from the community, helping to improve the extension over time.
