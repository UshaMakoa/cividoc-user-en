# Setting Up Your First Campaign in CiviCampaign

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the CiviCampaign component enabled in your CiviCRM installation. If you need help with this, ask your system administrator.

## Step 1: Create a New Campaign

1. **Go to Campaigns**: In your CiviCRM menu, find and click on “Campaigns.”
2. **Add New Campaign**: Click the “Add Campaign” button.
3. **Enter Campaign Details**:
   - **Name**: Give your campaign a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Mobilize the Masses 2025”).
   - **Description**: Briefly explain the campaign’s purpose and goals.
   - **Start and End Dates**: Set the timeframe for your campaign.
   - **Revenue Goal**: If you have a fundraising target, enter it here.
4. **Save**: Click “Save” to create your campaign.

## Step 2: Connect Activities to Your Campaign

Now, whenever you create an event, send an email, or record a donation, look for the “Campaign” field. Select your campaign from the dropdown to link that activity to your overall goal.

## Step 3: Track and Report

- **View Campaign Dashboard**: From the Campaigns section, select your campaign to see a summary of all linked activities.
- **Run Reports**: Use CiviCRM’s reporting tools to measure participation, donations, and other outcomes tied to your campaign.

## Tips for Success

- **Keep it Simple**: Start with one campaign to get familiar with the process.
- **Involve Your Team**: Make sure everyone knows which campaign to select when recording activities.
- **Review Regularly**: Check your campaign dashboard often to see progress and adjust your strategy if needed.
