# Reports and analysis

## Searching for campaign data

You can use CiviCRM’s search tools to find information about your organisation’s campaigns. Most components that can be part of a campaign—such as events, contributions, contacts, and memberships—include a **campaign filter**. This means you can search for records based on their connection to a specific campaign.

- When using advanced search, look for the campaign filter tabs to narrow your results by campaign participation.

- You can search for contacts who have participated in campaigns, or filter events, contributions, and other records by campaign.

## Reporting on campaigns

CiviCRM does not provide a single, dedicated campaign report. Instead, once you have enabled the CiviCampaign component, you can:

- Add a column for the associated campaign to reports about contributions, pledges, events, mailings, and memberships.

- Use the “filter by campaign” option in these reports to show only records linked to a particular campaign.

For activity reports, you can:

- Configure the report to display both the campaign and the engagement index.

- Filter the report by campaign and/or engagement index to focus on specific activities.

This approach helps you see how your campaigns are performing across different areas of your organisation.

Suggestion: This content is best structured as a Guide, because it addresses the practical steps users take to search and report on campaign data, focusing on actions rather than background or exhaustive reference. The level is Basic, as it is aimed at non
-expert users learning routine tasks. If the original page included more technical details about report configuration or campaign architecture, those could be split into Reference or Explanation pages. -->
