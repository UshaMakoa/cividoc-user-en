# Reports and analysis for your campaign

## Overview

CiviCRM offers several tools to help you understand and report on your campaign’s progress. This guide is for non-profit users who want to track their campaign activities but are not yet experts. You’ll learn how to use campaign filters in searches and reports, and how to add campaign information to your standard reports.

## Campaign searches

When you search for contacts, events, contributions, or other activities in CiviCRM, you can filter your results by campaign. This means you can quickly find everyone involved in a specific campaign, see which events are part of a campaign, or track contributions linked to a campaign. The campaign filter is available in both basic and advanced searches for most components.

## Campaign reports

There isn’t a single “campaign report” in CiviCRM. Instead, once CiviCampaign is enabled, you can add a “campaign” column to many standard reports—such as contribution, pledge, event, mailing, and membership reports. This lets you see which campaign each record is associated with. You can also filter these reports to show only records from a particular campaign.

For activity reports, you can display both the campaign and the engagement index (a measure of how involved a contact is). You can filter your activity report by campaign, engagement index, or both, helping you focus on the most relevant data for your campaign goals.

## Tips for non-profit users

- **Start simple**: Begin by adding the campaign column to one type of report you use often, such as contributions or events.
- **Filter as needed**: Use the campaign filter to focus on specific campaigns when reviewing reports.
- **Combine data**: Look at activity reports with both campaign and engagement index to get a fuller picture of your supporters’ involvement.

## When to split into separate pages

If your team needs more detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up campaign filters or creating specific types of reports, consider splitting this content. For example:
