# postal mail communications
## planning your mailing
Before starting any postal mail campaign, take the time to plan your approach. Consider the following questions:

- What types of mailings do you send to your constituents?
- Are mailings targeted to specific groups or sent to everyone in the database?
- How do you want to greet recipients (e.g., "Dear Jane" or "Dear Jane Doe")?

## using civicrm for postal mail
CiviCRM offers several ways to manage postal mail communications:

1. **Generate Labels**: Use CiviCRM to print standard address labels for non-personalized content, such as sending brochures.
2. **Export Contacts for Mail Merge**: Export contacts to external tools like OpenOffice or Microsoft Word for personalized mailings.
3. **Print/Merge Documents**: Use CiviCRM's built-in feature to create personalized documents directly within the system.

### greetings and salutations
You can set specific postal greeting formats for each contact, ranging from informal to formal. These can be customized in the Communications Preferences section of the contact edit form.
