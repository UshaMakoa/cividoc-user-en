# Automating tasks

## Why automate tasks in CiviCRM?

CiviCRM can help your organisation by taking over repetitive tasks—like sending reminders or personalising thank-you letters—so you and your team have more time for your mission. Automating these routine actions is sometimes called setting up *workflows*. While it may take some effort to set up, automation can save you a lot of time and reduce errors in the long run.

## How does automation work in CiviCRM?

Every routine decision you make—such as who gets a special thank-you, or when to send a renewal notice—can usually be described using clear criteria. For example, you might want to:

- Automatically send a personalised acknowledgment letter to each donor.

- Email yourself a daily report of major donations.

- Remind event registrants about upcoming events.

- Notify members when their membership is about to expire.

CiviCRM includes built
-in features to automate many of these tasks, and with some customisation, it can handle even more complex scenarios.

## Example: Personalising acknowledgment letters

Suppose you want to send each donor a thank-you letter that is tailored to their relationship with your organisation. To do this, you might:

- Decide which information you want to include (such as fund name, tax receipt status, or whether the donor is known by staff).

- Use CiviCRM’s custom fields and tokens to pull in the right details.

- Set up templates that automatically adjust the content based on each donor’s data.

For example, your template could include or exclude certain messages based on donation type, eligibility for a tax receipt, or the donor’s location.

## Planning your automation

To automate a task, start by asking yourself:

- What triggers the action? (e.g., a donation is received, a membership is expiring)

- What information do you need? (e.g., donor’s name, donation amount, membership type)

- What should happen next? (e.g., send an email, create a report, update a record)

Write down the steps you currently take manually, and note any information you have to look up or add. If you’re comfortable with “if…then” logic, try to describe your process in those terms. For example:

- If the donor’s city is nearby, include an invitation to visit.

- If the last contribution is over a certain amount, add a special message.

## Using CiviCRM features for automation

CiviCRM offers many features to help with automation, including:

- **Custom fields**: Add extra information to contacts, contributions, or events.
- **Custom tokens**: Pull specific details into emails or documents.
- **Scheduled jobs**: Run tasks automatically at set times.
- **Reports**: Generate and email summaries of your data.

When creating custom fields, try to use dropdown menus or checkboxes instead of free text, so information stays consistent and is easier to use in searches and reports.

## Addressing limitations and custom needs

Sometimes, you may find that CiviCRM’s standard options don’t cover your exact needs. For example, you might want to create a new type of relationship between contacts, or design a custom report. In these cases, it’s best to adjust the system configuration rather than work around it—fixing the root problem will make your automation more reliable.

If your needs are very specific, you may consider working with a CiviCRM expert to create custom reports or workflows.

## Aim high with automation

CiviCRM is designed to help you do more with less effort. The more you automate, the less time you’ll spend on manual tasks, and the more time you’ll have for your organisation’s goals.
