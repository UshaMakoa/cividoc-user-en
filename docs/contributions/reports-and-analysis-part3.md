## Installing additional reports

If you need reports beyond the standard set, explore the CiviCRM extensions directory. Many community-developed reports are available to download and install, expanding your reporting options.

## Custom reports and searches

- Hiring a developer to create a custom report or search.  
- Learning to build custom searches yourself using CiviCRM’s Search Kit tool.  
- Sharing your custom reports with the community to benefit other users.

## Tips for effective reporting

- Regularly review your reports to track fundraising health.  
- Use filters to focus on relevant data and avoid information overload.
