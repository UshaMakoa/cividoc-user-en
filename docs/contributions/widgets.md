# Widgets

## What are widgets?

Widgets in CiviCRM are small, automatically updated visual tools that help you and your supporters promote fundraising campaigns. You can embed these widgets on your website or other sites to show campaign details and encourage donations.

## Creating a widget

1. Go to **Contributions > Manage Contribution Pages** in CiviCRM.  
2. Find the Contribution Page you want to create a widget for and click **Configure**.  
3. Select the **Widgets** tab at the top.  
4. Click **Enable Widget** to start creating your widget.  
5. Enter a **Title** for your widget. This can be the same as your Contribution Page name or something different.  
6. (Optional) Add a URL for a **Logo Image** if you want an image to show in your widget. You will need the image URL from your website or server. Ask your system administrator if you need help.  
7. Enter a **Button Title** that donors will click to go to your donation page (e.g., "Contribute").  
8. Write some **About text** describing your campaign. Adjust the length based on where the widget will appear.  
9. Click **Save and Preview** to see your widget and get the code to embed it on your website.  

To use the widget code, click **Select Code** to highlight all the code, then copy and paste it into your website where you want the widget to appear. You may need help from your website administrator to do this.

## Customizing your widget

At the bottom of the widget configuration page, open the **Edit Widget Colors** section. Here you can change the colors of different parts of your widget by entering hexadecimal color codes (hex codes). You can find hex codes using online color pickers like the one at W3Schools.

If you have a web designer, check with them for the right colors to use to match your website style. After making changes, click **Save and Preview** to see how your widget looks.

## Using widgets with WordPress

If your website uses WordPress, there is a plugin called **CiviCRM Contribution Page Widget** that makes it easy to add your CiviCRM widgets anywhere WordPress widgets can go. This helps you display fundraising widgets without dealing with code directly.
