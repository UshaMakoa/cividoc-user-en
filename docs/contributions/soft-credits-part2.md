# How to add and view soft credits

## Adding a soft credit

1. **Go to the contribution record** for the donation you want to credit.
2. **Find the “Soft Credit” section** (usually near the bottom of the page).
3. **Click “Add Soft Credit”**.
4. **Search for and select the contact** who should receive the soft credit.
5. **Choose the soft credit type** (for example, “Solicited” or “In Honor of”).
6. **Save your changes**.

You can repeat these steps to add soft credits to multiple people for the same donation.

## Viewing soft credits

1. **Run a contribution detail report** from the Reports section.
2. **Look for the option to include soft credit columns** (often under “Display Columns” or “Fields”).
3. **Select the soft credit columns** you want to see.
4. **Run the report**.  
   You will now see which donations have soft credits and who received them.

## Enabling honoree information on contribution pages

1. **Edit your contribution page** in CiviCRM.
2. **Find the “Honoree Section” settings**.
3. **Check “Honoree Section Enabled”**.
4. **Select the honor types and profile** you want to use.
5. **Save your changes**.

Now, donors can enter honoree details when they give online.
