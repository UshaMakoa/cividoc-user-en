# What is CiviContribute?

## Overview

**CiviContribute** is a core part of CiviCRM that allows your organisation to keep track of all financial and in-kind contributions. This includes:

- Donations (one
-time and recurring)

- Membership signups and renewals

- Event registration fees

- In
-kind gifts (such as donated goods or services)

- Fundraising campaigns

- Personal campaign pages where your supporters can help fundraise

- Batch entry and export of payments for accounting

- Reporting and analysis of fundraising results

In CiviCRM, the term **contribution** means any financial transaction or payment, such as a donation, event fee, or membership fee. It also includes non
-cash (in-kind) contributions.

## Example: How a community group uses CiviContribute

Imagine a community arts group called *Arts in Action* that runs youth leadership workshops. They use CiviCRM to:

- Collect participant fees, donations, and funding from local arts bodies.

- Send donation requests by email, linking to an online donation page.

- Automatically send thank
-you emails and receipts to donors.

- Tag donations for specific workshops, so they can run reports on fundraising.

- Allow participants to register and pay online, or pay later in cash at the event.

- Record both actual payments and promises to pay, so staff can check who still owes money.

- Let participants invite friends by forwarding the registration link.

- Generate reports showing total income from different sources, track trends, and display key statistics on the staff dashboard.

CiviContribute helps organisations like Arts in Action manage all these tasks in one place, making it easier to track contributions, thank supporters, and report results to staff and board members.
