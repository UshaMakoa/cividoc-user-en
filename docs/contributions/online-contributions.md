# Creating an online contribution page

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to set up a simple online donation page in CiviCRM, so visitors can make contributions to your organisation directly from your website. You do not need technical expertise, and you can start with just the essential options.

## Before you begin

- Make sure your organisation has a payment processor set up in CiviCRM (such as PayPal or Stripe). This lets you accept online payments.

## Step 1: Start a new contribution page

- In CiviCRM, go to **Contributions > New Contribution Page**.

- Enter a **Title** for your donation page (e.g., "Support Our Work").

- Choose the appropriate **Financial Type** (such as Donation or Membership).

- Click **Continue**.

## Step 2: Set contribution options

- On the next page, tick **Allow Other Amounts** if you want donors to choose any amount.

- Optionally, set minimum and/or maximum amounts.

- Click **Save and Done**.

## Step 3: Add a thank
-you receipt (optional but recommended)

- Select the **Receipt** tab.

- Enter a **Title** for your thank
-you page.

- Tick **Email Receipt to Contributor** so donors get a confirmation email.

- Enter your organisationâ€™s **FROM email address**.

- Click **Save and Done**.

## Step 4: Publish your contribution page

- Follow the steps for your website platform (Joomla!, Drupal, or WordPress) to display the page:

  - **Joomla!**: Create a menu item and select your contribution page.
  - **Drupal**: Copy the page URL and add it to a menu or content page.
  - **WordPress**: Add a new Page or Post, click the CiviCRM icon, and select your contribution page.

## Step 5: Share your page

- Add a visible "Donate" button or link on your website.

- Consider sending an email to your supporters with a link to the page.

## Tips

- You can customise your page further with messages, goal amounts, and more, but these steps will get you started quickly.

- If you want to collect extra information (like interests or skills), you can add a Profile to your contribution page later.
