# Soft credits in CiviCRM

## What are soft credits?

Soft credits are a way for non-profits to recognize people who helped make a donation happen, even if they are not the official donor. For example, if a volunteer convinces ten friends to donate, soft credits let you thank the volunteer for their role, while still recording the actual donations correctly. This helps your organization understand who is really driving your fundraising success.

## Why use soft credits?

Soft credits help you:

- **Track the true impact** of your supporters, not just the donors.
- **Avoid double-counting** donations, so your reports stay accurate.
- **Recognize everyone involved** in fundraising, from volunteers to honorees.

## Types of soft credits

CiviCRM offers several built-in soft credit types, including:

- **In Honor of**: The donation is made in someone’s honor.
- **In Memory of**: The donation is made in memory of someone.
- **Solicited**: The donation was encouraged by someone else.
- **Personal Campaign Page**: The donation came through a supporter’s personal fundraising page.
- **Gift**: The donation is given as a gift.

You can also create custom soft credit types to fit your organization’s needs.

## How soft credits work

When a donation is made, you can assign soft credits to one or more people. For example, if Joe convinces Jane to donate, and the check comes from Jane’s company, you would:

- **Record the company as the donor** (so your accounting is correct).
- **Give Joe a “Solicited” soft credit** (to recognize his effort).
- **Give Jane a “Donor Advised” soft credit** (to acknowledge her role).

This way, everyone gets the right recognition, and your records stay clear.

## Reporting on soft credits

CiviCRM lets you include soft credit details in your reports. When you run a contribution detail report, you can choose to show extra columns with soft credit information. This helps you see the full picture of who is helping your cause.

## Honoree information and profiles

If you want donors to give in honor or memory of someone, you can enable the “Honoree Section” on your contribution page. This lets donors enter details about the person they are honoring. CiviCRM checks if the honoree is already in your system and creates a new contact if needed, adding a soft credit to their record.

## Soft credits and personal campaign pages

When someone donates through a supporter’s personal campaign page, the donation is automatically soft credited to the page owner. This makes it easy to track the results of peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns.
