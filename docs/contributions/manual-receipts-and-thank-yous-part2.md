# Your first thank-you letter: A step-by-step tutorial

## Before you start

Make sure you have a few test contributions entered in CiviCRM. If you’re new to CiviCRM, ask your system administrator to help set up a test contact and donation.

## Step 1: Find contributions

- Go to **Contributions** > **Find Contributions**.
- Enter search criteria (for example, contributions from the last month).
- Click **Search**.

## Step 2: Select contributions

- Check the box next to each contribution you want to include in your thank-you letters.
- If you want to thank everyone in your results, use the “Select all” option.

## Step 3: Choose the thank-you letter action

- From the **Actions** dropdown at the bottom of the page, select **Thank-you letters – print or email**.
- A new screen will appear with options for your letters.

## Step 4: Set your preferences

- **Update dates**: Choose whether to update the thank-you or receipt date for these contributions.
- **Print and email**: Select how you want to send the letters (PDF only, email where possible, or both).
- **Group contributions**: For now, leave this as “-no grouping-” (you’ll learn about grouping in the next guide).
- **Template**: Pick an existing template or create a new one. For your first time, use the default template.

## Step 5: Preview and send

- Click **Preview** to see how your letter will look.
- If you’re happy, click **Make Thank-you Letters**.
- CiviCRM will generate your letters and create an activity record for each one.

## Step 6: Review and learn

- Check your email or PDF output to make sure everything looks correct.
- Review the activity records to see a history of your communications.

Congratulations! You’ve just sent your first thank-you letters in CiviCRM. With practice, you’ll be able to handle larger batches and explore more advanced options.
