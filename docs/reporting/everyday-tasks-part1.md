# Everyday tasks in CiviCRM

## Viewing reports

To view a report in CiviCRM, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Reports** section from the main menu.
2. Choose the type of report you want to access.
3. Locate the specific report you wish to view. Click on **View Results** to see the report with preset criteria. If you want to adjust the criteria, click on the report name.

When you open a report, it will display as a table on your screen. Some reports can also be visualized as bar or pie charts. If this option is available, you can select your preferred format from a dropdown menu.

In addition to viewing reports, you can create a PDF version of the results for printing or emailing. If you need to analyze the data further, you can export it as a CSV file by clicking on **Export to CSV**.

If you have the necessary permissions, you can modify the report criteria and settings while viewing the report. For more detailed instructions on this, refer to the section on setting up reports.

## Reports on your dashboard

You can customize your dashboard to display specific reports, making it easier to access important information at a glance. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. From your dashboard, click on **Configure Your Dashboard**.
2. Select a report from the list of available reports.
3. Drag the report onto your dashboard.

Keep in mind that not all reports may be available for your dashboard.

## Adding report results to a group

Sometimes, you may want to add the contacts returned in a report to a group. This feature is available in certain reports. To do this:

1. After viewing the report, look for the option to add contacts to a group.
