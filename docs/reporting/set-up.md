# Set up a basic report in CiviCRM

## Find and select a report template

Go to **Administer > CiviReport** in your CiviCRM menu. Here, you’ll see a list of available report templates, grouped by the type of data they handle (like contacts, contributions, or memberships). Each template has a short description to help you choose the right one for your needs. If you’re not sure which template to use, pick one that matches the kind of information you want to see—for example, “Membership Detail” for a list of your members.

Click the name of the template you want to use. This opens the report configuration screen.

## Choose what information to include

You’ll see several tabs where you can customize your report. Here’s what each tab does:

- **Columns**: Check the boxes for the information you want to see in your report. Some columns are required and can’t be removed.
- **Grouping** (if available): Use this to summarize your data, like showing total donations by year or month.
- **Sorting** (if available): Choose how to order your results, such as alphabetically by name or by date.
- **Filters**: Narrow down your results. For example, show only members who joined in the last year, or only donations above a certain amount.

Most filters are easy to understand. For date ranges, you can pick exact dates or use options like “This year” or “Last 12 months” to keep your report up to date automatically.

After you’ve made your selections, click **Preview Report** to see how it looks.

## Adjust and preview your report

If the report doesn’t show exactly what you need, go back to the tabs and change your selections. Preview the report again until you’re happy with the results.

## Save and share your report

Once your report looks right, you need to save it so you can use it again:

- **Title and Format**: Give your report a clear name and description, so others in your organisation will know what it’s for.
- **Email Delivery** (optional): Set up the report to be emailed to you or someone else on a schedule.
- **Access**: Decide who can see or edit this report. You can add it to your menu, restrict it to certain users, or even put it on your dashboard for quick access.

When everything is set, click **Create Report**. Your new report will appear in **Reports > All Reports** and, if you chose, in your navigation menu.

## Edit or copy a report

If you need to change a report later, open it, make your changes, and click **Update Report** to save. If you want a similar report with different filters (for example, one report for events and another for fundraisers), open the original, change the filters, and click **Save a Copy**. Give the new report a different name and description.

## Report permissions

CiviCRM lets you control who can view, edit, or manage reports. There are special permissions for reports, so you can make sure only the right people see sensitive information.

<!--
This page is a How
-to Guide: it focuses on the steps to achieve a specific task (creating and configuring a report) without explaining background concepts or theory. It is practical, action-oriented, and assumes the user knows why they want a report but not how to make one. The content is well-suited for non-expert users who need clear, step-by-step instructions. If the page included more about why certain report types exist or how reports fit into your organisation’s workflow, those parts would belong in an Explanation. Similarly, a full list of every possible column, filter, or permission would belong in a Reference. For best learning, consider splitting off exhaustive lists and technical details into a separate Reference page, and deeper context into an Explanation page. -->
