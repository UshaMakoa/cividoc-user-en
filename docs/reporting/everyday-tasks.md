# Everyday tasks for using reports

## Viewing reports

To view a report in CiviCRM:

- Go to **Reports** in the main menu.

- Select the relevant report type from the list.

- Find the report you want to see.

- Click **View Results** to see the report with its current settings.

- Click the report name to adjust the report’s criteria and settings if you have permission.

Reports may also be added to your navigation menus for quick access. For example, an event report can appear directly in the Events menu.

When you open a report, it usually appears as a table. Some reports let you choose to view the data as a bar or pie chart using a dropdown menu.

You can also:

- Create a **PDF** version of the table or chart for printing or emailing.

- Export the data as a **CSV file** to use in a spreadsheet (for further calculations or analysis).

If you want to change the filters or layout of a report, you need the right permissions. For more details on changing reports, see the setup section.

## Adding reports to your dashboard

You can display specific reports on your dashboard (the first page you see after logging in):

- On your dashboard, click **Configure Your Dashboard**.

- Choose a report from the list of available reports.

- Drag the report onto your dashboard.

Not all reports may be available for the dashboard, depending on how they were set up.

## Adding report results to a group

If you want to add contacts from a report to a group:

- In some reports, you will see an option to add the contacts to a group.

- Use the dropdown menu to choose the group you want to add the contacts to.

This feature is not available in every report, but it is useful for organizing contacts for future mailings or activities.

Suggestion: This page is a Guide, as it gives step
-by-step instructions for common reporting tasks, without background or reference detail. The content is basic, as it assumes users are not experts and focuses on everyday use. If more detail about report setup or customization is needed, that should be split into a separate Guide or Reference page. -->
