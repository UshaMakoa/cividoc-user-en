This rewritten content follows the Diataxis framework by providing an **Explanation** document at a **Basic** level to introduce non-expert users to CiviReport concepts and usage. The content is split into two pages to separate conceptual understanding from practical steps, making it easier for learners to digest. The tone is inclusive, encouraging, and uses plain English to support non-profit users new to CiviCRM reporting.
