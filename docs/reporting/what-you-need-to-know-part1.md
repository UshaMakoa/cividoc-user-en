# What you need to know about CiviReport

## Introduction

CiviReport is a powerful tool in CiviCRM that helps you analyze and understand your organisation’s data through reports. These reports can show information in tables or graphs and can be scheduled to email automatically to people who need them. This page explains the key ideas behind CiviReport to help you decide when to use reports and how they can support your work.

## Key concepts

### Report templates

A report template is like a starting point for creating reports. CiviCRM includes many ready-made templates designed for common needs in non-profits, such as membership or donation reports. You can use these templates as they are or customize them if you have special needs, though customization requires technical skills.

### Report vs. Search

CiviCRM has built-in search tools that cover many needs. Use search when you want to quickly find or act on a list of contacts or records. Reports are better when you want to regularly answer the same questions about your data, especially if you want to see summaries or detailed views. Note that reports don’t support batch actions like updating records directly, so for those tasks, search is better.

### Report options

- **Run the report:** You can view reports in your browser, print them, save as PDF, or export data to a spreadsheet.
- **Dashlets:** Reports can be added to your dashboard for quick access to up-to-date information like recent donations or new members.
- **Email:** You can schedule reports to be emailed regularly, such as monthly financial summaries or weekly membership updates.

### Detail vs summary reports

Reports often come in pairs: a summary report gives you an overview, and a detail report lets you drill down into specific information. This helps you quickly understand the big picture and then explore the details when needed.

## Key questions to consider

Before creating or using a report, ask yourself:

- Is a report the best way to get this information, or would a search be easier?
- What reports are already available in your system?
- What specific questions do you want to answer about your data?
- Which fields and details do you need in your report?
- Will you need to analyze the data further outside CiviCRM?
- Is this a one-time report or something you will use regularly?
- Who needs to see this report, and does it contain sensitive information?
