# What is CiviReport?

CiviReport is a powerful tool within CiviCRM that helps your organization create, run, and schedule reports based on the data you have about your contacts and their interactions with your organization. This functionality is essential for evaluating your impact and fulfilling reporting requirements for funders and stakeholders.

## Why use CiviReport?

Reports are crucial for understanding your organization's performance and making informed decisions. With CiviReport, you can generate various reports that provide insights into your fundraising efforts, member activities, and overall contributions. Reports can be displayed on your dashboard, sent via email, or exported as CSV or PDF files.

## Scenarios for using CiviReport

### A simple report to help with fundraising

Imagine your organization, 1two3, is launching a capital campaign to raise funds for a new shelter. Anne, the development director, wants to reconnect with donors who made significant contributions last year but haven't donated this year. 

1. Anne creates a "Last Year But Unfortunately Not This" (LYBUNT) report that filters for donors who contributed over â‚¬500 last year.
2. She runs the report and uses the "Add to Group" button to create a new group of these donors.
3. Anne can now send personalized emails to this group, inviting them to contribute to the capital campaign.
4. By adding the report to her CiviCRM dashboard, she can track the progress of her outreach efforts. Donors who contribute will automatically be removed from this list, allowing her to focus on those who still need to be contacted.

### A regular financial report

Consider WAM, an academic membership organization with around 1,500 members. Their finance officer, Mark, needs regular reports to monitor incoming funds. CiviReport automates this process, allowing him to receive timely updates.

1. Every Monday, Mark gets an email with a CSV attachment listing all completed online payments from the previous week. This report includes details like payment amounts, purposes (membership or event), and reference IDs for tracking.
2. At the end of each month, he receives a report of members whose direct debit payments are due for renewal in the following month. This helps him set up the necessary payments in their online banking system.

These automated reports save Mark hours each month, enabling him to focus on more critical financial management tasks.

### Determining total contributions for a household

In Ohio, a non-profit organization keeps records of individuals organized by households. When a family member calls to inquire about contributions or event payments, staff need a quick way to access all relevant information.

1. They can run the "Donation Summary Report (Household)" using the household name to see total contributions from everyone in that household.
2. This comprehensive view allows staff to answer questions efficiently and provide the best service to their supporters.

CiviReport is an invaluable resource for non-profits using CiviCRM. By leveraging its capabilities, you can enhance your reporting processes, improve communication with donors, and ultimately support your mission more effectively.
