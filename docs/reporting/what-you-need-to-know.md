# What you need to know about CiviReport

## Introduction

CiviReport is a tool in CiviCRM that helps your organisation understand, analyse, and share information about your contacts, donations, memberships, and more. Reports can be shown as tables or charts, and you can set them up to be emailed to the right people on a schedule.

## Key concepts

### Report templates

- **Report templates** are starting points for creating reports. CiviCRM comes with several built-in templates, such as membership or contribution reports, designed to meet the common needs of non-profits.

- You can use these templates to create specific reports, like a list of new members this quarter or all cancelled memberships this year.

- If your organisation has special reporting needs, new templates can be created by someone with technical skills (using PHP and SQL). These can also be shared with the wider CiviCRM community.

### Reports vs. Search

- **Reports** are best when you want to regularly answer the same question or need a summary or detailed view of your data that you can share or schedule.
- **Search** is better when you want to perform actions on results, like updating records or creating smart groups, as reports do not support most batch actions.

- Reports let you change which columns are shown and how results are sorted, especially in summary reports.

### Report options

- **Run the report:** View it in your browser, print it, save as PDF, or export to CSV for use in spreadsheets.
- **Dashboard:** Make a report available on your dashboard so you or others can see updates (like new members or donations) every time you log in.
- **Email:** Schedule regular emails of a report to team members, such as sending a monthly income report to your finance team.

### Detail vs. summary reports

- Many reports come in two versions: a **summary** (showing totals or grouped data) and a **detail** (showing each record).

- These are often linked, so you can start with a summary and click through for more detail if needed.

## Key questions to consider

- Should you use a report or a search for your task?

- What reports are already available in your system?

- What questions do you want your report to answer (e.g., new members this month, total donations for an event)?

- What information (fields) do you need in the report?

- Does the report give you everything you need, or will you need to do more analysis in a spreadsheet?

- Is this a one
-time report, or will you need to run it regularly?

- Who should see this report? Does it contain sensitive information or is it useful for everyone?

For more details on specific reports available for each part of CiviCRM (like memberships or contributions), see the relevant section in this guide.

Suggestion: This page is best classified as an Explanation, as it provides background, context, and conceptual understanding of CiviReportâ€”what it is, why you might use it, and how it fits with other features like Search. It is not a step
