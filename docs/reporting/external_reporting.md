# External reporting

In this guide, we will explore the options available for external reporting in CiviCRM. Reporting can be a powerful tool for non-profits to analyze their data and make informed decisions. 

## Understanding external reporting

When it comes to reporting in CiviCRM, there are two key points to keep in mind:

1. **Real-time data**: This guide assumes you want to generate reports directly from your live CiviCRM database, ensuring you have the most current information at your fingertips.
   
2. **CiviCRM data only**: The focus here is on reporting data that resides solely within CiviCRM. If you need to combine this data with information from other applications, you will need to explore additional tools.

## Tools for external reporting

While CiviCRM offers built-in reporting features, there are also many external tools that can help you create comprehensive reports, dashboards, and data visualizations. Some popular options include:

- **Metabase**
- **Tableau**
- **Power BI**
- **RapidMiner**
- **Pentaho**

These tools can connect to your CiviCRM database, either through a direct link to the MySQL or MariaDB database or via the CiviCRM API.

## Getting help

If your organization lacks the technical skills needed to set up these external reporting tools, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for assistance. Your CiviCRM experts or support team can provide guidance and help you get started.

By leveraging both CiviCRM's internal capabilities and external reporting tools, you can gain valuable insights into your organization's data, helping you to enhance your mission and impact.
