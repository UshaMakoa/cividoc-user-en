# What is CiviPledge?

## Understanding pledges in CiviCRM

A **pledge** is a promise from a donor to give a donation at a future time, either as a single payment or in regular installments until a total amount is reached. For example, a donor might pledge to give $3,000 over five years by paying $50 each month.

## How pledges work in CiviCRM

In CiviCRM, donors can make pledges themselves through an online contribution form, or staff can enter pledges on their behalf. The pledge acts like an umbrella that groups together all the individual payments related to that promise.

Payments toward the pledge are handled separately. They can be made manually, such as by cheque, or automatically using a payment processor.

## Managing pledges and reminders

If a donor misses a payment, the status of their pledge can be updated to reflect this. CiviCRM can also send automatic email reminders before payments are due to help donors keep their commitments.
