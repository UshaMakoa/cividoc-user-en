# Enable and configure pledges for online donations

## Overview

Pledges in CiviCRM let your supporters commit to making regular donations in the future, such as monthly or annually. This guide walks you through the steps to enable and set up pledges on your online donation forms, making it easy for your non-profit to offer flexible giving options.

## Before you begin

- You should already have a contribution (donation) page set up in CiviCRM.
- You need administrative access to edit your contribution page settings.

## Enable pledges on your contribution page

1. **Edit your contribution page**: Go to the contribution page you want to enable pledges on.
2. **Go to the Amounts tab**: While editing the page, select the **Amounts** tab.
3. **Enable pledges**: Check the box labeled **Pledges**. This will reveal additional options for configuring how pledges work on your form.

## Configure pledge options

Once pledges are enabled, you’ll see several settings you can adjust to fit your organization’s needs:

- **Supported pledge frequencies**: Choose which intervals donors can select (daily, weekly, monthly, annually).
- **Allow frequency intervals**: If enabled, donors can set custom gaps between payments (e.g., every 3 months).
- **Send payment reminder**: Set how many days before a payment is due a reminder is sent to the donor.
- **Send up to**: Limit how many reminders are sent for each scheduled payment.
- **Send additional reminders**: Set how often follow-up reminders are sent if a payment is missed.
- **Allow other amounts**: Let donors enter their own pledge amount, with optional minimum and maximum limits.
- **Fixed contribution options**: Enter up to ten preset amounts donors can choose from.

After adjusting these settings, save your changes. The pledge option will now appear on your online form.

## View and manage pledges

To see a list of current pledges and their statuses, go to **Contributions > Pledges > Dashboard**. Here, you can monitor incoming pledges and follow up as needed.

## Notes and tips

- **Manual payments**: If a donor pays by cheque or another offline method, you can record the payment manually and update the pledge status from ‘Pending’ to ‘Complete’.
- **Reminders**: Automated reminders help keep donors engaged and reduce missed payments.
- **Advanced options**: For more complex pledge scenarios, such as creating pledges on behalf of constituents (not through the online form), refer to the full Pledges chapter in the CiviCRM documentation.

## Next steps

Once you’ve set up pledges, consider testing the process with a small group of users to ensure everything works as expected. You can also explore reporting options to track pledge fulfillment and donor engagement over time.
