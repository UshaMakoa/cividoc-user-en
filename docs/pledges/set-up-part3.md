# What are pledges and why use them?

Pledges allow your donors to commit to making regular donations over time, such as monthly or annually, rather than giving a one-time gift. This can help your organization predict future income and build stronger relationships with supporters.

When a donor makes a pledge through your online form, CiviCRM tracks the commitment and can send automated reminders before each payment is due. If a donor pays by cheque or another offline method, you can record the payment manually. Pledges also appear in reports and dashboards, making it easy to monitor fulfillment and follow up as needed.

Using pledges can increase donor retention and provide a steady stream of support for your mission. They are especially helpful for fundraising campaigns, events, and ongoing donor engagement programs.
