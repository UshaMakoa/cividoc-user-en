# How to create and manage a petition in CiviPetition

## Before you start

Make sure you have the CiviCampaign component enabled in your CiviCRM installation. If you’re not sure, ask your system administrator.

## Step 1: Plan your petition

Decide what you want to achieve with your petition. Write clear questions and a brief description of your cause. Think about who you want to reach and how you will share the petition (email, website, social media).

## Step 2: Create your petition

1. Go to **Campaigns** > **New Petition** in your CiviCRM menu.
2. Enter a title and description for your petition.
3. Add the questions you want to ask supporters.
4. Set the start and end dates for your campaign.
5. Choose whether to collect contact information and offer an opt-in for updates.
6. Save your petition.

## Step 3: Share your petition

- **Email:** Send the petition link to your contacts using CiviMail.
- **Website:** Add the petition to your website so anyone can sign.
- **Social media:** Share the link on your organization’s social channels to reach a wider audience.

## Step 4: Monitor responses

As people sign your petition, their responses will appear in CiviCRM. You can view and export this data at any time.

## Step 5: Analyze and report

After your petition closes, use CiviCRM’s reporting tools to analyze the results. Create reports to share with your team, board, or decision-makers.

## Step 6: Follow up

Thank everyone who signed your petition. If they opted in, keep them updated on your campaign’s progress and next steps.

## Tips for success

- Keep your petition questions clear and simple.
- Test your petition before launching to make sure everything works.
- Promote your petition through multiple channels to reach as many people as possible.
- Regularly check for new signatures and respond to any questions or comments.
