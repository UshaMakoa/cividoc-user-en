# Everyday tasks for managing petitions in CiviCRM

## Manage your petitions  
To start managing your petitions, go to **Campaigns > Dashboard > Petitions**. Here you can view, edit, and organize all your petitions in one place.

## Send out a petition for signing  
Once your petition is ready, you need to share it so people can sign it:  
- Go to **Campaigns > Dashboard > Petitions**.  
- Find your petition and click **More > Sign**.  
- Copy the petition URL shown.  
- Share this link by email or add it to your website so people can access and sign the petition online.

## Collect responses online  
After sharing the petition link, supporters can fill out the petition form and submit their responses. When they sign, they will see a message asking them to check and verify their email address to confirm their signature.

## Collect signatures  
To see who has signed your petition:  
- Go to **Campaign > Dashboard > Petitions**.  
- Click **More > Signatures** next to the petition name.  
- You can view individual petition activity or select multiple contacts to send emails or perform batch updates.

## Review results with activity report  
To analyze petition responses:  
- Navigate to **Reports > Create Reports from Templates > Activity Report**.  
- Select the fields you want to see, such as contact emails.  
- Expand the Petition Questions section to filter results by specific answers.  
- Click **Preview Report** to view the data.  
- You can also export the report as a CSV file for further analysis.
