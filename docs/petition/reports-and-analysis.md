# Reports and analysis

## Viewing petition signatories

You can easily see who has signed your petition in CiviCRM.

- Go to **Campaign** in the main menu, then select **Dashboard**.

- Click on **Petitions** to see your list of petitions.

- Find your petition and click **More**, then choose **Signatures** next to its name.

This shows you a list of everyone who has signed your petition.

## Reviewing petition results with reports

To get a detailed overview of petition responses, use the Activity Report tool.

- Go to **Reports** in the main menu.

- Select **Create Reports from Templates** and choose **Activity Report**.

- In the **Display Column** area, pick any fields you want to include in your report, such as *Target Contact Email*.

- Expand the **Petition Questions** area and select the criteria or specific responses you want to review.

- Click **Preview Report** to see your results.

You can also export the report to a CSV file for further analysis or sharing.

Suggestion: This page is a Guide because it provides step
-by-step instructions for achieving specific goals (viewing signatories and reviewing results), not a general tutorial for first-time users, nor a reference or explanation. The level is Basic, as it assumes no prior reporting experience and uses simple actions. If the page included more detailed options for customizing reports, those could be split into Reference. -->
