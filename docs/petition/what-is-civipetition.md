# What is CiviPetition?

## Introduction

**CiviPetition** is a feature within CiviCRM’s CiviCampaign component that lets your organisation create online petitions to gather signatures and responses from the public. This tool is especially useful when you want to collect support for a cause or gather opinions from people who may not already be in your contact list.

## What can you do with CiviPetition?

- **Create online petitions** that anyone can sign, even if they are not already in your database.
- **Collect responses to questions**—not just signatures—so you can learn more about what people think about your cause.
- **Share petitions on your website** and through email to reach a wider audience.
- **Build support and awareness** for your campaigns by analysing and sharing the results.

## Example scenario

Imagine your organisation wants to show the city council how the community feels about public housing. You could:

- Set up a petition using CiviPetition, including questions about public housing.

- Email the petition to your existing contacts and add it to your website for anyone to sign.

- Encourage people to sign and share the petition.

- Offer respondents the option to receive updates about your campaign.

- Use the collected signatures and responses to create reports, which you can present to the city council or use in your communications.

## Why use CiviPetition?

- **Reach new supporters:** Anyone can sign, not just people already in your database.
- **Gather valuable feedback:** Collect opinions and data alongside signatures.
- **Support your advocacy:** Use results to influence decision-makers or raise awareness.
