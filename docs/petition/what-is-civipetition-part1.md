# What is CiviPetition?

## Introduction to CiviPetition

CiviPetition is a feature within CiviCRM that helps non-profit organizations create online petitions to collect signatures and gather responses from the public. It is especially useful for campaigns where you want to demonstrate public support for a cause, educate people about an issue, or collect feedback from a wide audience—including people who might not already be in your contact database.

## How CiviPetition works

When you create a petition in CiviCRM, you can ask people to sign their name and answer questions about your cause. This information is collected directly in your CiviCRM system, making it easy to track who has signed, what they said, and how they want to be involved. You can share your petition by email, on your website, or through social media, so anyone can participate—not just your existing contacts.

## Example: City Council petition

Imagine your organization wants to show local government how the community feels about an important issue, like public housing. You can use CiviPetition to create a petition that asks people to share their opinions and sign their name. You might email the petition to your supporters and also post it on your website for the wider community. As people respond, their answers and contact details are saved in CiviCRM. After the petition closes, you can create reports to analyze the results and share them with decision-makers or use them to shape your organization’s messaging.

## Why use CiviPetition?

- **Build public support:** Show decision-makers that your cause matters to the community.
- **Gather information:** Collect feedback, stories, and contact details from new and existing supporters.
- **Stay connected:** Let people opt in to receive updates, helping you grow your supporter base.
- **Easy reporting:** Use CiviCRM’s tools to analyze results and share your findings.
