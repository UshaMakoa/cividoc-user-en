# What you need to know about petitions in CiviCRM

## Key concepts

- **Petitions** are a feature of the CiviCampaign component in CiviCRM. When someone signs a petition, CiviCRM creates an activity record of type "Petition" that includes their responses to the petition questions.
- **Petitions are like online surveys.** They collect information from people who sign, and this data can be used for analysis or follow-up.
- **Petitions and campaigns:** While petitions are part of the CiviCampaign tool, you do not have to link every petition to a campaign. For example, you might use a petition to get feedback from your members without connecting it to a larger campaign. However, linking a petition to a campaign lets you see how petition responses fit with your other campaign activities.

## Profiles and custom fields

- When a visitor signs a petition, CiviCRM saves their contact details and creates an activity record.

- **Profiles** are used to display and collect the information you want from petition signers.

- The **contact profile** gathers basic information, such as the signer's email address. This is required to help you verify submissions and avoid counting multiple signatures from the same person.

- The **activity profile** can collect extra information specific to the petition.

- Before you create a petition, prepare any **custom fields** you want to use for your questions. Then, set up the profiles, and finally select the profiles when creating the petition.

## CMS permissions

- You must set permissions in your website system (CMS) to allow the right people to sign CiviCRM petitions. Check the Set
-up section for details on which permissions are needed.

## Key questions to consider

Before creating your petition, think about these questions to help plan your approach:

- Will you send the petition by email?

- Will you link to the petition on your website for people to sign?

- Will you use social media or offline methods to encourage people to sign?

- How will you write your message so people want to sign?

- What will you do with the results of the petition?

- What follow
-up actions will you take to keep in touch with signers and build relationships?
