# event planning and management
## planning your event
To effectively plan an event in CiviCRM, consider the following key questions:

- **Event Type**: What kind of event is this, and what types of events does your organization typically host?
- **Participant Roles**: What roles will participants have during the event?
- **Participant Information**: What information do you need to collect from participants, such as food or lodging preferences?
- **Registration Process**: Will you allow online registrations? Are there limits on the number of participants?
- **Registration Confirmation**: Will registrants receive confirmation of their registration?
- **Public Participant List**: Should the list of participants be public?
- **Recurring Events**: Is this a recurring event with similar details? If so, consider using event templates.
- **Event Fees**: Will this be a paid event? If so, what financial type will the event fees be categorized as?

## promoting your events
To promote your event effectively, consider the following strategies:

- **Target Audience**: Identify who you want to attend the event and where they typically get their information.
- **Promotion Channels**: Determine which channels (e.g., social media, email) are best for reaching your audience.
- **Event Listing**: Prominently list your event on your organization's website and public calendar.
- **Registration Information**: Ensure it's clear how people should register for the event, especially if promoting on other platforms.

## following up after the event
After the event, update participant statuses and consider sending follow-up emails to attendees. These emails can thank attendees, provide links to documentation, and promote future events or membership opportunities.

If the content is too extensive, you might consider splitting it into multiple pages, each focusing on a specific aspect of event planning and management.

### Potential Split:
1. **Event Setup and Planning**: Focus on the initial setup and planning phase.
2. **Event Promotion Strategies**: Detail effective ways to promote events.
3. **Post-Event Follow-Up**: Cover best practices for after the event.

Each of these could be a separate page, maintaining the Diataxis framework's focus on clear, user-centered documentation.
