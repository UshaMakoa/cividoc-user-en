# What is CiviEvent?

## Overview

**CiviEvent** is a tool within CiviCRM designed to help your organisation plan, promote, and manage events of any size. It streamlines event administration, making it easier for you to handle registrations, payments, communications, and reportingâ€”all in one place.

## What can you do with CiviEvent?

- Allow people to register for events themselves, including paying online if needed.

- Track who has signed up, cancelled, or attended.

- Promote your events on your website and by email.

- Save time by reusing event templates for similar or recurring events.

- Check in participants at the event using any computer with internet access.

## Example: Youth leadership workshop

Imagine a community arts group, "Arts in Action," that runs youth leadership workshops. They use CiviEvent to:

- Create an event page with an online registration form.

- Use an event template to quickly set up similar events.

- Let attendees choose workshops and pay online.

- Collect extra information (like food preferences) during registration.

- Invite targeted groups using personalised emails.

- Share the event on their website and let attendees invite friends.

- Monitor registrations, manage waitlists, and handle questions.

- Check in participants on the day and collect any outstanding payments.

- Generate reports after the event to see attendance and payments.

- Update templates for future events.

## Key concepts

- **Events**: Organised activities (like workshops or fundraisers) that your contacts can attend.
- **Participants**: Contacts who sign up for or attend your events.
- **Event types**: Categories for your events (such as Conference, Meeting, Fundraiser). These help you organise, report on, and customise events.
- **Participant roles**: Labels for how someone is involved (such as Attendee, Volunteer, Speaker). You can customise these roles to fit your needs.
- **Participant statuses**: Stages of involvement (like Registered, Attended, Cancelled). These help you track and communicate with participants.

## How CiviEvent works with other CiviCRM features

- **CiviMail**: Send invitations and updates to participants.
- **CiviContribute**: Accept online payments for event fees.
- **Profiles**: Gather extra information from participants during registration.
