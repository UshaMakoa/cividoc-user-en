# Using reports to analyze your events and participants

## Overview

CiviCRM offers several ways to report on and analyze your events and participants. The event dashboard gives a quick snapshot of up to 12 upcoming events, showing how many people have registered and their statuses. However, if your organisation runs many events or needs detailed analysis, you can use CiviCRM’s search features and reporting tools for more in-depth insights.

If you are interested in financial reporting for events, you may also want to look at the “Reports and analysis” section in Contributions.

## Searching based on participant data

CiviCRM treats **contacts** (the people in your database) and **event participants** (people who attend events) differently. Sometimes you want to know which contacts attended events in a certain year; other times, you want to know how many sessions were delivered as part of a specific program.

- Use **Find Participants** to search and return participant data.

- Use **Advanced Search** to combine participant information with other contact details. You can choose to display results as either contacts or participants.

You can see simple totals in your search results, and you can export the data as a CSV file for further analysis in a spreadsheet.

## Event and participant reports

Reports offer features that searches do not, such as aggregating data from multiple events or filtering by registration dates. Repeating the same searches can be time
-consuming, and creating many Smart Groups can clutter your system. Instead, set up reports for specific events or collections of events.

CiviCRM includes four built-in event reports:

- **Event Participants List**: Shows participant and individual data, including custom fields. You can use all these fields as filters.
- **Attendee List**: Lists event attendees, filterable by event. You can format this as a sign-up sheet.
- **Event Income Detail** and **Event Income Summary**: Show revenue details for events. The summary report gives total income for a series of events, and you can click on an event for a detailed breakdown by role and status. These reports can be displayed as pie or bar charts.

## Creating an event report from a template

For step-by-step instructions on creating reports, see the “Reporting Set-up” chapter.

## More analysis

If built-in reports or searches don't meet your needs, you can commission a new report or create a custom search. See the CiviReport section for more information.

## Displaying an event report on your dashboard

Once you have created an event report, you can display it on your CiviCRM home dashboard:

1. From the navigation menu, click **Reports** and select the report you want to display.

2. In the **Report Settings** area, check the **Available for Dashboard?** box.

3. Click **Update Report**.

To add the report to your dashboard:

1. Go to **Home** to view your dashboard.

2. Click **Configure Your Dashboard**.

3. Drag the desired report from the **Available Dashlets** area into either the left or right column of the dashboard, then click **Done**.

4. You will now see your report on your home dashboard. Click **Refresh Dashboard Data** to update the information.
