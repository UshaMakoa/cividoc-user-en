# Understanding event settings in CiviCRM

## Why event details matter

Clear event titles and descriptions help attendees understand what to expect and encourage registration. Detailed information builds trust and makes your event more appealing.

## Participant roles and listings

Assigning roles helps you track different types of attendees (e.g., speakers, volunteers). Participant listings can showcase support for your event and build community engagement.

## Fees and payment options

Setting up fees allows you to collect payments for tickets or donations. Offering multiple payment methods (online, pay later) makes it easier for everyone to participate.

## Online registration

Online registration saves time for your team and provides a smooth experience for attendees. It also helps you gather important information and manage your guest list.

## Automated communications

Scheduled reminders and confirmation emails keep attendees informed and reduce the chance of no-shows. Customizing these messages helps you maintain a professional and friendly tone.

## Social sharing

The “Tell-A-Friend” feature turns your attendees into ambassadors, helping you reach a wider audience and grow your community.
