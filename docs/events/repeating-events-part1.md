# Repeating events

## What are repeating events?

Repeating events let you schedule an event to happen regularly on a certain day and time. You can set how often it repeats (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly), choose when the repetition ends, and exclude specific dates if needed. This helps you manage ongoing activities without creating each event separately.

## How to set up a repeating event

1. Go to **Manage Events** in your CiviCRM dashboard.
2. Find the event you want to repeat or create a new one.
3. Under the **Configure** dropdown menu, select **Repeat** to open the Repeat Event screen.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Repeating intervals**: Choose how often the event repeats (hours, days, weeks, months, or years).
   - **Event end date**: The last date the event will occur.
   - **Occurrence end date**: The end date for the repeated occurrences.
   - **Repetition start date**: The date when the repeating schedule begins (recommended).
   - **Excluded dates**: Any dates you want to skip in the repeating schedule (recommended).
5. Click **Save** to apply your settings.
6. A popup will ask you to confirm your choices. Click **Continue** to finalize.

## Important tips for repeating events

- If you want **Scheduled Reminders** (like email notifications) to repeat with your event, set them up on the original event before creating the repetition. You can edit reminders later if needed.
- Avoid setting reminders to repeat on specific days. Instead, schedule them to send a certain number of days or weeks before each event occurrence for better consistency.

## Why use repeating events?

Repeating events save time and reduce errors by automating the scheduling of regular activities. This is especially useful for classes, meetings, or fundraisers that happen on a regular basis.
