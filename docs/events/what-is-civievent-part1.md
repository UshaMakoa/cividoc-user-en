# What is CiviEvent?

## Introduction to CiviEvent

CiviEvent is a set of tools within CiviCRM designed to help you organize and run events more easily. It reduces the amount of manual work by handling tasks like participant registration, payment processing, and attendance tracking. Whether your event is simple or complex, CiviEvent supports you every step of the way.

Some key features include:

- Online self-registration for participants, including credit card payments  
- Tracking of sign-ups, cancellations, and attendance  
- Promoting events on your website  
- Using event templates to quickly set up similar or recurring events  
- Checking in participants on-site using any internet-connected computer  

## Scenario: Youth leadership workshop

Imagine a community arts group called Arts in Action that runs leadership workshops for young people under 25. They want to attract new attendees and encourage past participants to volunteer as teachers.

Using CiviEvent, Arts in Action staff can:

- Create an event page with an online registration form  
- Use an event template to save time on setup  
- Set a flat registration fee with optional extra workshops  
- Collect participant preferences like food and lodging during registration  
- Send personalized email invitations using CiviMail with a direct registration link  
- Publicly announce the event on their website and enable a "Tell-a-friend" feature  
- Manage registrations, payments, and waitlists easily  
- Check in attendees on the event day and update attendance in real time  
- Generate reports after the event to evaluate success and plan improvements  

## Key concepts to understand

Before setting up your event, it helps to know some basic ideas used in CiviEvent:

### Events, participants, and contacts

- An **event** is an activity you organize, like a workshop or fundraiser.  
- A **contact** is anyone in your database, such as a participant or volunteer.  
- A **participant** is a contact who takes part in an event.  

### Event types

You can create different **event types** to organize your events, such as Conferences, Meetings, or Fundraisers. Event types help you categorize events and collect specific information relevant to each type.

### Participant default roles

Each participant has a **role** that describes how they are involved, like Attendee, Volunteer, Host, or Speaker. You can customize these roles to fit your organizationâ€™s needs. Roles help you communicate and organize participants effectively.

### Participant statuses

Participant **statuses** track where someone is in the event process, such as Registered, Attended, Cancelled, or No-show. These statuses help you manage attendance and send targeted communications.

### Integration with other CiviCRM features

CiviEvent works with other parts of CiviCRM to support your event management:

- **CiviMail** for sending invitations and follow-up emails  
- **CiviContribute** to accept online payments (requires setup of payment processors)  

By combining these tools, you can manage your events smoothly from planning to follow-up.
