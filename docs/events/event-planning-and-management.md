# Event planning and management

## Planning your event

Before you start setting up an event in CiviCRM, it helps to think through your goals and the experience you want for your participants. Here are some key questions to guide your planning:

- What types of events does your organisation hold, and what is the purpose of this event?

- What roles will participants have (e.g., attendee, speaker, volunteer)?

- What information do you need to collect from participants, such as dietary or lodging preferences?

- Will you allow people to register online?

- Is there a maximum number of participants?

- Do you want to approve registrations, or should anyone be able to sign up?

- If the event fills up, will you use a waitlist?

- Should one person be able to register multiple people at once?

- Will participants receive a confirmation after registering?

- Do you want to make the participant list public?

- Is this event repeated regularly with similar details?

- Is there a fee to attend? If so:

- What financial category will the fees use?

- What is your fee structure (flat fee, multiple options, discounts)?

- Will you charge for extras, such as meals or sessions?

- Will you offer early
-bird discounts?

Carefully considering these questions will help you set up your event efficiently and collect the information you need. If you run similar events often, consider using event templates or the event copy feature to save time.

## Promoting your events

Think about who you want to attend and where they usually get their information. This will help you choose the best ways to promote your event:

- What channels will you use to promote your event (website, email, social media)?

- Will you post your event on your website and allow online registration?

- Is email a good way to reach your audience?

- Is the event by invitation only? Who are you inviting?

- Have you planned a schedule for invitations and reminders?

Make sure your event is easy to find on your website and public calendar. If you publicise your event elsewhere (like partner websites or social media), make it clear how people should register. Some sites have their own registration systems, so always specify where and how to sign up.

## Following up after the event

After the event, update each participant’s status in CiviCRM to keep your records accurate. It’s a good idea to send a thank
-you email to everyone who attended, with links to any materials or follow-up actions. You might also want to:

- Send a different message to people who registered but didn’t attend.

- Invite attendees to future events, encourage them to join your organisation, or ask for donations.

You can automate these follow
-ups using CiviCRM’s scheduled reminders feature.
