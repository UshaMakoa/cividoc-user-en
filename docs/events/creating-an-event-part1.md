# Creating an event in CiviCRM

## Getting started

To create a new event, go to **Events > New Event** in the main menu. If you don’t see the Events menu, make sure the Events component is enabled under **Administer > System Settings > Components**.

## Event information and settings

Start by filling out the basic details for your event. You’ll see fields for the event title, summary, and a full description—use these to clearly communicate what your event is about. The title will appear on registration pages and event listings, so make it clear and inviting.

- **Event type**: Choose a category that fits your event.
- **Campaign**: If you use CiviCampaign, you can link this event to a specific campaign.
- **Roles**: Set the default participant role (usually “Attendee”).
- **Participant listings**: Decide if you want to show a list of attendees and how much information to share.
- **Dates and times**: Enter when your event starts and ends.
- **Maximum participants**: Set a limit if needed, and add a message for when the event is full.
- **Public event**: Check this box to include your event in public listings.
- **Social sharing**: Allow attendees to share your event on social media.
- **Active/Inactive**: Keep your event inactive until you’re ready to promote it.
- **Calendar links**: Enable this if you want attendees to add the event to their calendars.

Click **Continue** to save your progress and move to the next step. You can always come back later to edit these settings.

## Event location

Enter the location details for your event. You can reuse locations for future events by selecting “Use existing location.” Add contact information if you want attendees to reach event organizers directly. You can also choose whether to show the location on registration and event information pages.

## Fees

- **Free event**: Select “No” for paid event and skip to the next section.
- **Paid event**: Select “Yes” and set your payment options. Choose a contribution type (usually “Event Fee”) and configure payment processors if you’re accepting credit cards.
- **Pay later**: Enable this if you want to allow offline payments, and provide instructions for attendees.
- **Regular fees**: Set up simple price levels (e.g., individual, family). For more complex pricing, consider using price sets or discounts.

## Online registration

Decide if you want to allow online registration. If you do, check **Allow Online Registration**. For more details on setting up online registration, see the dedicated guide in this section.

## Scheduled reminders

Set up automated emails to remind attendees about your event. You can send reminders before or after the event, and target them by participant status or role. You can also set reminders for specific event types or templates.

## Tell-A-Friend

Enable the “Tell-A-Friend” feature to let attendees share your event with their networks. You can customize the message and track who shares your event.

## Registration confirmation and receipting

CiviCRM can send automatic confirmation and receipt emails to attendees. You can customize these messages using message templates. Test any changes to make sure the emails look right before your event goes live.
