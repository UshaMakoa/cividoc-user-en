5. **Click Save.**

## Step 3: Add a Custom Field

1. **Click “Add Custom Field”** within your new set.
2. **Choose a field type** (e.g., Checkbox for multiple topics, Dropdown for a single choice).
3. **Enter a label** (e.g., “Topics Covered”).

5. **Click Save.**

## Step 4: Use Your Custom Field
