# creating event templates in civicrm

## what are event templates?
Event templates in CiviCRM allow you to create a set of predefined settings that can be applied to multiple events, making it easier to manage events with similar configurations.

## why use event templates?
Using event templates saves time by pre-filling common settings for events, such as location, event fees, and online registration settings.

## how to create an event template
1. **Navigate to Event Templates**: Go to *Events > Event Templates*.
2. **Add a New Template**: Click *Add Event Template*.
3. **Enter Template Details**:
   - Give your template a descriptive title that clearly identifies the type of event.
   - Select an event type.
   - If applicable, choose a campaign to associate with all events created from this template.
4. **Configure Template Settings**: Continue with the event setup process, selecting the settings that will remain constant for all events created from this template.

## using event templates
Once you have created an event template, you can select it when creating a new event. The event will be pre-filled with the saved configuration properties from the template.

If the content seems too complex or if there are additional advanced features that could be covered separately, you might consider splitting it into multiple pages, such as:

### Advanced Event Template Customization
This could cover more complex scenarios, like customizing event fees or integrating with campaigns.

### Troubleshooting Event Templates
This section could address common issues or errors encountered when using event templates.

However, for a basic guide, the above structure should suffice.
