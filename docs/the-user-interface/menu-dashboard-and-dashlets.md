# Menu, dashboard and dashlets

## Understanding the navigation menu

The navigation menu is a small bar at the top of every CiviCRM page you use behind the scenes. It groups the main functions of CiviCRM into areas like Contacts, Contributions, Events, Mailings, Reports, and Administration.

Key parts of the menu include:

- **Quick Search**: Quickly look up names, emails, or other contact details.  
- **Menu Search and Logout**: Search the whole menu to find what you need or log out.  
- **Search**: Search your CiviCRM data in detail.  
- **Contacts**: Find, add, and manage your contacts.  
- **Contributions**: Manage donations and contribution pages.  
- **Events**: Create and manage event registrations.  
- **Mailings**: Send bulk emails and check past mailings.  
- **Reports**: Generate and view reports.  
- **Administer**: Change system settings and add custom data.  

## Quickly finding menu items

If you’re not sure where a menu item is, you can search for it easily:

- Hover over the **CiviCRM logo** in the top menu bar.  
- A small panel appears with a search box and a list of menu items.  
- Start typing part of the menu item name (for example, "groups" or "display preferences").  
- The list filters to show matching items.  
- Click the item to go directly to that page.  

This helps you find what you need without memorizing the menu structure.

## Modifying the menu

You can change the menu to better fit your needs by going to:

**Administer > Customize > Navigation Menu**

Here you can add, disable, or rearrange menu items.

**Important:** Changes affect everyone who can see that menu, so be careful when editing.

## The home dashboard and dashlets

When you log in to CiviCRM, you see the **dashboard** (also called CiviCRM Home). This page shows important information about your organization using **dashlets** — small reports displayed on your dashboard.

### Common dashlets include:

- **Donor report**: A bar graph showing total donations.  
- **Activities**: A list of recent actions like emails sent, donations received, or meetings scheduled.  
- **Membership report**: A table summarizing membership details by month, including member counts and payments.  

### Adding or changing dashlets

To customize your dashboard:

1. Click the **Configure Your Dashboard** button.  
2. Drag dashlets from the available list into the left or right column.  
3. Click **Done** to save your layout.  

Dashlets update each time you log in. To refresh manually, click **Refresh Dashboard Data**.

### Creating new dashlets from reports

Any CiviReport can become a dashlet:

1. Go to **Reports > My Reports** and click **New Report**.  
2. Choose a report template and set up columns, sorting, and filters (for example, filter by date).  
3. Click **View results**.  
4. Select how to display the report: table, bar chart, or pie chart.  
5. On the **Access** tab, check **Available for Dashboard?**  
6. Click **Actions > Create Report**.  

Then add the new dashlet to your dashboard as described above.

### Notes

- Dashlets cache data for performance. You can adjust how often they refresh in the report settings.  
- You can also use **Search Kit** with **FormBuilder** to add dashlets (see FormBuilder documentation for details).  

This guide helps you get comfortable with the CiviCRM interface so you can find what you need quickly and keep your dashboard showing the most useful information for your work.
