# Taking action on search results in CiviCRM

## What you can do from search results

CiviCRM lets you quickly complete tasks for groups of records right from your search results page. This is useful when you want to update, communicate with, or organize many contacts, contributions, participants, activities, or members at once. The actions available depend on the type of records you are viewing.

To use these actions, first search for the records you need, then select one or more results. The “Actions” menu will show options relevant to your selection.

## Contact search actions

Here are some common actions you can take after searching for contacts:

- **Add activity**: Record a new activity (like a phone call or meeting) for the selected contacts.
- **Change communication preferences**: Update how these contacts receive emails or other communications.
- **Merge contacts**: Combine duplicate contact records, moving related information as needed.
- **Delete contacts**: Move contacts to the trash (they can be restored later if needed).
- **Download spreadsheet**: Export your search results to a file for use in Excel or other tools.
- **Email contacts**: Send an email to the selected contacts, either immediately or as part of a larger mailing.
- **Export contacts**: Save contact data using a predefined or custom export format.
- **Add or remove from groups**: Organize contacts by adding them to or removing them from groups.
- **Print mailing labels**: Generate labels for postal mailings.
- **Print/merge document**: Create personalized letters using data from your contacts.
- **Update contacts**: Edit information like address or phone number for all selected contacts at once.

## Tips for getting started

- Always select the records you want to work with before choosing an action.
- Some actions, like merging contacts or sending emails, have limits on how many records you can select.
- If you’re not sure what an action does, try it with a small test group first.
- For more complex tasks, like updating custom fields, you may need to set up a profile in advance.

## When to ask for help

If you’re unsure about an action or its consequences, check the relevant section of the CiviCRM documentation or ask a colleague or your system administrator for guidance. Taking action on groups of records is powerful, so it’s good to double-check before making large changes.
