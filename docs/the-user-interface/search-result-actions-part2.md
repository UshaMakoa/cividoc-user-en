# Sending an email to contacts from search results

## Before you begin

Make sure you have searched for and selected the contacts you want to email. You can select up to 50 contacts for a quick email, or use CiviMail for larger groups.

## Step 1: Search for contacts

Use Quick Search, Advanced Search, or Search Kit to find the contacts you need.

## Step 2: Select contacts

Check the boxes next to the contacts you want to email. You can select all results or choose specific ones.

## Step 3: Open the Actions menu

At the top of your search results, click the “Actions” button.

## Step 4: Choose “Email - send now (to 50 or less)”

Select this option to compose and send your email immediately.

## Step 5: Compose your email

Enter your subject and message. You can use tokens to personalize your email with contact details.

## Step 6: Send your email

Review your message, then click “Send”. CiviCRM will show a confirmation once your email has been sent.

## Tips

- If you need to send to more than 50 contacts, use the “Email - schedule/send via CiviMail” option for mass mailings.
- Contacts who have opted out of email or have no email address will not receive your message.
- You can save your message as a template for future use.
