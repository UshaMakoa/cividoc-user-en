# Search results actions

CiviCRM lets you quickly take action on your data right from the search results screen. The actions you see depend on what type of data you searched for—such as contacts, contributions, event participants, activities, or memberships. For every type, you must first select one or more records before the action options become available.

## Contact search actions

When you search for contacts, you can:

- **Add activity**: Record a new activity (like a call or meeting) for the selected contacts.
- **Change communication preferences**: Update how contacts want to be reached (for example, opt out of bulk emails).
- **Dedupe – merge contacts**: Combine two duplicate contacts into one. Only works if exactly two contacts are selected.
- **Delete contacts**: Move contacts to the trash. You can restore them later if needed.
- **Download spreadsheet**: Export the selected contacts and their visible fields to a file.

This page is a Reference because it systematically lists available actions for each search type, without step
-by-step instructions or background explanation. The content is factual, organized by entity type, and is intended for quick lookup by users who want to know what each action does. Level is Basic because it is aimed at non-experts learning what options are available. If desired, separate How-to Guides could be created for common tasks (e.g., “How to export contacts from search results”). -->
