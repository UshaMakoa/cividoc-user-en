# Restore deleted contacts

## Recovering a deleted contact

When you delete a contact in CiviCRM, it is first moved to the trash instead of being removed right away. This means you can restore the contact later if needed.

To recover a deleted contact:

1. Go to **Advanced Search** in CiviCRM.

2. Enter the details of the contact you want to recover.

3. In the **Basic Criteria** section, check the box labeled **Search in Trash**.

4. Click **Search** to see results that include deleted contacts.

5. In the results list, you can:

- Restore a single contact by clicking the **Restore** link at the end of the contactâ€™s row.

- Restore multiple contacts by selecting them and choosing **Restore contacts** from the action drop
-down menu.

## Permanently deleting a contact

If you are sure you no longer need a contact, you can delete it permanently from the trash.

## Disabling the trash feature

If your organisation prefers not to use the trash (so contacts are deleted immediately), you can turn off this feature:

- Go to **Administer > System Settings > Misc (Undelete, PDFs, Limits, Logging, etc.)** and adjust the settings as needed.

Suggestion: This is a Guide because it provides step
-by-step instructions to achieve a specific goal (recovering deleted contacts), fits a basic skill level, and belongs in the "Organising your data" section. No splitting needed; the reference to disabling the trash is minor and relevant for context. -->
