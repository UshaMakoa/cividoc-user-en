# Restore deleted contacts in CiviCRM

## Find deleted contacts

When a contact is deleted in CiviCRM, it is moved to the trash rather than being permanently removed. This means you can recover accidental deletions if you act quickly.

To find deleted contacts:

- Go to **Advanced Search**.
- Enter the contact’s details to help narrow your search.
- At the bottom of the **Basic Criteria** section, check the **Search in Trash** box.
- Click **Search**.

## Restore deleted contacts

Once you see your deleted contact in the search results, you have two options to restore them:

- **Restore individually:** Click the **Restore** link at the end of the row for the contact you want to recover.
- **Restore multiple contacts:** Use the action drop-down menu at the top of the results list and select **Restore contacts**.

After restoring, the contact will reappear in your main contact list and all their information will be available as before.

## Permanently delete contacts

If you are certain you no longer need a contact, you can delete them permanently. This action cannot be undone, so use it with care.

## Disable the trash function

If your organisation prefers not to use the trash, you can disable this feature. Go to **Administer > System Settings > Misc (Undelete, PDFs, Limits, Logging, etc.)** and adjust the setting there.

## Tips for non-profit teams

- **Regularly check the trash** if you suspect a contact has been accidentally deleted.
- **Communicate with your team** about when to restore or permanently delete contacts to avoid confusion.
- **Review your settings** to make sure the trash function matches your organisation’s data retention policy.

This guide is designed for non-profit staff who are new to CiviCRM and need to manage their contact data confidently. If you have questions or need more advanced options, ask your system administrator or check the CiviCRM community for support.
