# Creating and using a walk list in CiviEngage

## Introduction

A walk list helps your team organize door-to-door canvassing by providing a list of addresses and key information for each contact. This tutorial guides you through creating and using a walk list in CiviEngage.

## Steps

**1. Prepare your contact data**  
Make sure your contacts have accurate, standardized address information. Clean your data if needed.

**2. Create a Smart Group**  
Go to Contacts > New Smart Group. Set criteria to target the audience you want to canvass (e.g., by location, interest, or voter status).

**3. Generate the walk list**  
With your Smart Group selected, choose “Export” and select the fields you need for canvassing (name, address, phone, notes). Export the list as a CSV file.

**4. Distribute the list**  
Share the CSV file with your canvassing team. They can use it on their devices or print it for field work.

**5. Record responses**  
After canvassing, have your team record survey responses or notes in CiviCRM. You can use CiviEngage’s survey tools to capture this data directly.

**6. Review and update**  
After the campaign, review the data collected. Update contact records and use the information to plan future outreach.

## Tips

- Double-check addresses before exporting to avoid wasted trips.
- Use custom fields to track specific information collected during canvassing.
- Train your team on how to enter data accurately in CiviCRM.
