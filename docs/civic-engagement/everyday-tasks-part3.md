# Mobilising individuals to a direct action event

CiviCRM helps you track and encourage participation in your organisation’s events. Here’s how you can mobilise individuals and record their engagement:

##
1. Build your invitation list

- Use a basic or advanced search, or use Groups and Smart Groups, to create a list of contacts you want to invite.

##

2. Add contacts to the event

- From the search results or Group Contacts screen, select **Add Contacts to Events** from the actions list to register multiple contacts for an event (see Mass Registrations for more details).

##

3. Record participant information and responses

- After adding contacts to the event, you can record participant information (such as needs for childcare or transport) in the **Participant Info** area of each contact’s participant record.

- To update information for many participants at once, use **Batch Update Participants Via Profile** and choose a relevant custom profile, such as:

  - **Update Event Invite Responses** (to record responses from multiple contacts)
  - **Update Participant Info** (to record general information about participants)

##

4. Use the engagement index

- You can record how engaged or interested each contact is in an activity (such as a phone call, meeting, or interview).

- From a contact’s record, click **Actions** and select an activity (like Meeting).

- Fill out the activity details and enter the Engagement Index.

##

5. Manage voter information

- Export contacts (including Contact ID, name, address, etc.) to your voter management system if needed.

- After an election or campaign, import updated contacts back into CiviCRM.

- Use the **Voter Info** custom field set to record voter information for each contact.

Suggestion: This content is best structured as a set of How
-to Guides (Diátaxis: Guide), as it gives step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. Each task (door-knock canvass, phone bank, mobilising event participants) is a distinct guide. The content is basic, aimed at non-expert users. If more background or conceptual explanation is needed (e.g., what is a campaign, what is a survey), those should be split into separate Explanation or Reference pages. -->
