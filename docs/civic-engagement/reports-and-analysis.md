## How to analyse results from a door-knock canvass

If your organisation has conducted a door-knock canvass and recorded survey responses in CiviCRM, you can easily create a report to review and analyse your results.

1. Go to **Campaigns** in your CiviCRM dashboard.

2. Select **Create Reports from Templates**.

3. Choose **Survey Report (Detail)**.

4. In the **Display Columns** section, tick the boxes for the information you want to see, such as *Street Number*, *Street Name*, *Street Unit*, and *Survey Responses*.

5. In the **Group By Columns** section, tick boxes like *Street Name* or *Odd/Even Street Number* if you want to group your results by these fields.

6. In the **Set Filters** section, select your survey name under *Survey*, and set *Respondent Status* to “Is Equal to Interview”.

7. Click **Preview Report**.

You can now review your results on screen. If you need to do further analysis, you can export the report as a CSV file for use in spreadsheet software.
