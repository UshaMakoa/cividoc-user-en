# What is CiviEngage?

CiviEngage is a special Drupal module that comes with CiviCRM for Drupal 7 sites. It is designed for non-profits and community organizations—especially those focused on civic engagement and organizing in the United States—who want to track how people get involved with their work over time. If your organization uses Joomla! or WordPress, CiviEngage is not available for you.

## What does CiviEngage do?

CiviEngage adds tools to CiviCRM that help you:

- **Track engagement:** Record how people interact with your organization, like attending events, joining campaigns, or participating in surveys.
- **Manage walk lists and call lists:** Create lists for door-to-door canvassing and phone banking, making it easier to organize outreach and follow-up.
- **Analyze involvement:** Use custom fields and reports to see how people move through different levels of engagement, helping you understand what works in your organizing efforts.
- **Integrate with campaigns and surveys:** Connect your outreach work with CiviCampaign and CiviSurvey, so you can plan, execute, and measure your impact all in one place.

CiviEngage also provides a model for organizing information about your constituents, making it easier to see who is most involved and how they participate over time.

## Who is CiviEngage for?

CiviEngage is for non-profits and community groups who want to deepen their relationships with constituents through direct action, canvassing, and phone banking. It is especially helpful if you need to track who attends events, who volunteers, and how people respond to your outreach—so you can follow up effectively and measure your impact.

## Example scenarios

**Direct action:** Imagine your organization is mobilizing people to attend a rally at the state capitol. With CiviEngage, you can create a list of people to call, record their responses, and track who actually attends. After the event, you can see how many people you reached, how many came, and how effective your outreach was.

**Canvassing:** If you’re running a door-knock campaign to talk with community members about an issue, CiviEngage helps you create walk lists for volunteers, record survey responses, and analyze the data to plan your next steps. This way, you can see what matters to your community and adjust your strategy accordingly.

## Key points to remember

- **CiviEngage is only for Drupal 7 sites running CiviCRM.**
- **It is built for US-based community organizing, but the concepts can inspire similar work elsewhere.**
- **It works alongside CiviCampaign and CiviSurvey for integrated campaign management and analysis.**
- **There is no direct replacement for other CMS platforms at this time.**

If your organization does community organizing, canvassing, or phone banking—and you use CiviCRM on Drupal 7—CiviEngage can help you track, manage, and learn from your engagement efforts.
