# Understanding CiviEngage concepts

CiviEngage helps you manage interactions with community members during civic engagement activities like door-to-door canvassing and phone banking. This page explains the essential concepts you need to know before setting up CiviEngage for your organization.

## What CiviEngage does

CiviEngage provides tools for community organizing and base-building work. It works together with CiviCampaign to help you conduct surveys during canvasses, run phone banks, manage petition drives, and track how engaged your community members are with your work. When you combine CiviEngage with CiviCampaign, you can create walk lists for canvassers, organize phone banking sessions, and analyze responses from your community to plan your next steps.

## How CiviEngage works with CiviCampaign

CiviEngage and CiviCampaign complement each other. CiviEngage adds specialized features for organizing while CiviCampaign provides the campaign management framework. Together, they let you survey people during door knocking, collect petition signatures with detailed information, generate reports on community responses, and record engagement levels to identify highly active members. You'll find detailed information about CiviCampaign in the Campaign section of this guide.

## Organizing information with custom fields

CiviEngage includes pre-built custom field sets designed specifically for organizing work. These fields help you organize information about constituents, create walk lists and phone bank lists, and collect survey responses. Custom fields let you track details that matter for your organizing beyond basic contact information. The Creating Custom Fields section in Organizing Your Data explains how to use and modify these field sets.

## Preparing your address data

Clean address data means your street addresses follow consistent formatting rules. This consistency is crucial for CiviEngage because it allows accurate searching by location and creates reliable walk lists. CiviCRM expects addresses to include separate elements like street number, street name, and unit number in standardized formats.

Before importing existing contact data into CiviCRM, take time to standardize your addresses. The Address Settings section in Initial Set-up provides details about how CiviCRM handles addresses. If you're adding contacts manually, you'll enter each address component separately following these standards.

## Managing custom data carefully

CiviEngage installs custom groups, fields, and values that power its reports and searches. If you decide certain custom data isn't useful for your organization, **disable** it rather than deleting it. Reports and searches depend on these custom fields, so deleting them can break functionality. Disabling keeps the data structure intact while hiding it from view.

## Identifying your target audiences

Your organizing campaigns require identifying specific groups of people to contact. CiviCRM uses Groups and Smart Groups to define these audiences. You might create Smart Groups to find contacts based on voter demographics, issue interests, or primary language. Regular Groups can track newsletter subscribers or people interested in specific issues. Both types of groups generate walk lists and phone bank lists for your campaigns.

The custom Voter Info data group helps you track voter-specific information. The Tags and Groups section in Organizing Your Data explains how to create and use groups effectively for targeting.

## Working with voter information

CiviEngage lets you manage voter history and information collected during campaigns. Many organizations maintain a separate voter file for electoral work. After an election cycle, you might want to import only the contacts you actually reached during your campaign along with relevant voter information like responses to campaign questions, voter ID numbers, and party registration.

These imported voter records become regular contacts in CiviCRM that your organizers continue engaging through ongoing base-building efforts. This approach keeps your CiviCRM database focused on people you have direct relationships with.

## Tracking specialized contacts

CiviEngage creates special contact subtypes that help you track relationships important to organizing work. For individual contacts, you can mark someone as a Media Contact, Funder Contact, or Elected Official. For organizations, you can designate Media Outlets and Foundations.

**Working with funders and foundations:** Track grant deadlines by adding activities with types like Proposal, Letter of Inquiry, or Report. Record funding priorities and issue interests using the Funder Info custom field set for individuals and Grant Info for foundation organizations.

**Working with media:** Identify which reporters or outlets cover your issues and have written about your work. Track media type (television, newspaper, photographer), issue interests, and coverage area using the Media Info custom field set.

**Working with elected officials:** Record elected officials by district and maintain information about their staff like schedulers or spokespeople. Use the Elected Official Info custom field set to track their position, role, and related details.

The Set-up section explains how to customize these subtypes for your specific needs.

## Planning your approach

Consider these questions as you plan to use CiviEngage:

**About your community:** Who makes up your organization's constituency? What issues affect them most directly?

**About relationships:** Which individuals and organizations beyond your membership matter for your workâ€”community leaders, donors, elected officials, media contacts, or funders?

**About organizing data:** What information do you need about constituents to create targeted communications and mobilize them effectively?

**About voter engagement:** Will you conduct voter engagement activities? How will you integrate that data with your existing contact information?

Answering these questions helps you configure CiviEngage to match your organizing strategy and community context.
