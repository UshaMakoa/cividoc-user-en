# Setting up CiviEngage

## Before you begin

Make sure you have installed CiviCRM and have administrator access. Review the “What You Need To Know” section to understand the key concepts and questions for your work.

## Steps to set up CiviEngage

**1. Enable CiviEngage**  
Go to the Extensions menu in CiviCRM and enable the CiviEngage extension.

**2. Review and customize contact subtypes**  
CiviEngage adds new contact subtypes like Media Contact, Funder Contact, and Elected Official. Decide which subtypes are relevant for your organization and customize them as needed.

**3. Set up custom fields and profiles**  
Create or review the custom field sets for civic engagement (e.g., Voter Info, Media Info, Grant Info). Add any fields that are specific to your outreach goals.

**4. Clean your address data**  
Before importing contacts, standardize your address data to ensure accurate walk lists and reports. Use the Address Settings section for guidance.

**5. Create Smart Groups and regular Groups**  
Set up groups to target specific audiences for your campaigns. Use Smart Groups to automatically include contacts based on criteria like demographics or interests.

**6. Plan your data import**  
If you have existing voter or contact data, clean and prepare it for import. Focus on importing only the data you need for ongoing engagement.

**7. Test your setup**  
Create a test campaign, add a few contacts, and try out features like surveys, walk lists, and reports to make sure everything works as expected.
