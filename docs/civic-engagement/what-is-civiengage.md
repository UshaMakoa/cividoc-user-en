# What is CiviEngage?

## Overview

**CiviEngage** is an extra module for CiviCRM that you can use only if your organisation’s website runs on Drupal
7. It is not available for WordPress or Joomla sites.

CiviEngage is designed for non-profits focused on community organizing and civic engagement, especially in the USA. It helps you manage and track how people interact with your organisation over time, making it easier to organize activities like door-to-door canvassing and phone banks.

## What does CiviEngage do?

- Adds custom fields, reports, and features to CiviCRM so you can keep a detailed history of your constituents’ involvement and activities.

- Integrates with CiviCRM’s Campaigns and Surveys to help you create walk lists (for canvassing) and phone bank lists.

- Provides a way to organize and understand information about individuals, groups, and their interactions with your organisation.

## Who can use CiviEngage?

- Only organisations using CiviCRM on Drupal
 7.

- There is currently no version for WordPress or Joomla.

## How does CiviEngage help?

CiviEngage gives you tools to:

- Track who you contact, how you contact them, and what happens as a result.

- See how people’s involvement changes over time, helping you build stronger relationships and measure your impact.

- Organize your data in a way that supports community organizing and advocacy work.

## Example scenarios

### Direct action

Suppose your organisation wants to mobilize supporters for a direct action event at the state capitol. With CiviEngage, you can:

- Identify people to invite based on location, interests, or leadership roles.

- Create an event in CiviCRM and add groups of potential participants.

- Use phone bank lists to call supporters and track their responses (e.g., attending, not available, wrong number).

- Follow up multiple times and record each interaction.

- After the event, analyze who said they would attend, who actually attended, and how effective your outreach was.

### Canvassing

If you want to learn more about your community’s views by going door
-to-door:

- Define your target audience based on location or other criteria.

- Create a campaign in CiviCRM and set up a survey for canvassers to use.

- Build walk lists for volunteers, who then visit homes and record responses.

- Enter all responses into CiviCRM for analysis.

- Use the data to plan follow
-up actions and improve your engagement strategy.

By tracking all this information, your organisation can see patterns, measure progress, and plan more effective campaigns.
