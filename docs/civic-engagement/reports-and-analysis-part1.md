# Reports and analysis

## Introduction

Reports help you understand and make use of the data in your CiviCRM system. This guide shows you how to create and use reports to analyze information from your campaigns and activities, such as door-knock canvasses and phone banks. You donâ€™t need to be an expert to follow these steps.

## What are reports in CiviCRM?

CiviCRM provides built-in report templates that make it easy to gather and view information about your contacts, campaigns, and activities. Reports can be viewed on screen or exported as CSV files for further analysis.
