# Creating a new profile

Follow these steps to create a Profile tailored to your nonprofit’s needs.

## 1. Plan your profile

Before you start, think about:

- **Who will use this Profile?** (e.g., volunteers, members, staff)
- **What information do you need to collect or display?**
- **Where will this Profile be used?** (e.g., on your website, in an email, within CiviCRM)

## 2. Create the profile

1. Go to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Profiles**.
2. Click **Add Profile**.
3. Give your Profile a clear, descriptive name.
4. Choose what the Profile will be used for (e.g., Standalone Form, Directory, Search Views, User Registration).
5. Set the order if you’ll use multiple Profiles on the same page.
6. Add helpful text before or after the form if needed.
7. Make sure “Is this CiviCRM Profile Active?” is checked.

## 3. Add fields

1. Click **Add Field**.
2. Select the record type (e.g., Contact, Activity, Participant).
3. Choose the specific field you want to include.
4. Edit the field label to make it clear for your users.
5. Decide if the field is required or view-only.
6. Set visibility (e.g., Public Pages for directories, User and User Admin only for internal forms).
7. For directories, choose if the field is searchable and/or appears in results.
8. Add any help text to guide users.
9. Save and repeat for all fields you need.

## 4. Review and test

- **Preview** your Profile to see how it looks.
- **Test** the form with a few sample entries.
- **Edit** fields or settings as needed.
