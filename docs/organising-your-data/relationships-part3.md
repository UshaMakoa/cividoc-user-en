# Why relationships matter in CiviCRM

## The value of tracking relationships

Relationships help you see how people and organizations in your database are connected. This is especially important for non-profits, where understanding these connections can improve outreach, reporting, and personalized communication.

## Common uses of relationships

- **Family connections**: Track parents, children, siblings, and other family ties.
- **Organizational ties**: Record who works for which organization, who sits on which board, or which organizations partner with each other.
- **Household management**: Link individuals who share an address or belong to the same household for mailing or reporting purposes.

## How relationships support your work

By accurately recording relationships, you can:

- **Segment your audience** for targeted communications.
- **Generate more meaningful reports** that reflect real-world connections.
- **Respect privacy** by controlling who can see or edit relationship information.
- **Reduce duplicate data** by linking related contacts instead of creating separate records.

## Getting started

If you’re new to CiviCRM, start by exploring the built-in relationship types and practice creating a few connections between contacts. As you become more comfortable, consider adding custom types and fields to match your organization’s unique needs.
