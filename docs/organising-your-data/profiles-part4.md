# Planning and managing your profiles

Profiles are powerful, but they have many settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls and keep your Profiles working well.

## Plan before you build

- **Start simple**: Build one Profile for one purpose, then expand as you get comfortable.
- **Test as you go**: Try your Profile with real users to catch confusing fields or missing options.
- **Document your choices**: Keep notes on why you set each field and setting—it will help when you need to update the Profile later.

## Advanced settings to consider

- **Limit listings to a group**: For directories, restrict which contacts are visible (e.g., only current members).
- **Add new contacts to a group**: Automatically add people who fill out a form to a specific group.
- **Notify when submitted**: Get an email alert when someone submits a form.
- **Redirect after submission**: Send users to a thank-you page after they submit the form.
- **Include reCAPTCHA**: Help prevent spam by requiring users to complete a CAPTCHA.
- **User account options**: Let (or require) people to create a website account when they fill out a Profile.

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Field combinations**: Some fields can’t be mixed in the same Profile. If you get an error, check the field types.
- **Visibility**: Make sure fields are visible to the right people (e.g., Public Pages for directories, User and User Admin only for internal forms).
- **Testing**: Always test your Profile with different user roles to make sure it works as expected.

## Where to find more help
