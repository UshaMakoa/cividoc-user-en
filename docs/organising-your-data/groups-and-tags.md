# Groups and tags

## What are groups and tags?

**Groups** and **tags** are two main ways to organize your data in CiviCRM. Both help you segment and search your database, but they work differently and are best suited to different tasks.

- **Groups**: Collections of contacts that share something in common. Groups are often used for sending mailings, managing access rights, or keeping track of specific teams or committees.
- **Tags**: Labels you can attach to contacts, activities, or cases to describe them. Tags are good for flexible, descriptive categories.

For example:

- Use a **tag** like "vegetarian" or "musician" to describe a contact.

- Use a **group** like "Board of Directors" or "Newsletter Subscribers" to manage a set of people you want to treat as a unit.

## Types of groups

There are two main types of groups in CiviCRM:

- **Regular groups**: You manually add or remove contacts. For example, you might add board members to a "Board of Directors" group.
- **Smart groups**: CiviCRM automatically updates these groups based on rules you set (such as "all donors from California this year"). When a contact meets the criteria, they are added; if they no longer meet it, they are removed.

## How groups and tags differ

- **Groups** are best when you need to manage a defined set of people (like for mailings or access control).
- **Tags** are best for adding descriptive information to contacts, activities, or cases.

You can use both together for powerful searching and segmentation. For example, you might search for all "journalists" (group) interested in "environment" (tag).

## Benefits and limitations

**Benefits of tags:**

- Easy to set up and use.

- Good for searching and combining with other properties.

- Flexibleâ€”can be used on contacts, activities, and cases.

**Limitations of tags:**

- Cannot limit tags to specific contact types.

- All tags show on edit forms.

- Not ideal for mutually exclusive categories.

**Benefits of groups:**

- Great for segmenting contacts for mailings or special access.

- Support recurring tasks (like sending newsletters).

- Allow for visibility settings (public or admin
-only).

- Smart groups update automatically.

**Limitations of groups:**

- Can become overwhelming if too many groups are created.

- All groups appear in the Manage Groups screen.

- Groups used for short
-term projects should be cleaned up when no longer needed.

## When to use groups vs tags

- Use **groups** when you need to manage a set of contacts as a unit, especially for mailings, permissions, or access.

- Use **tags** when you want to add descriptive information that helps with searching or reporting.

This page is best categorized as an Explanation, as it focuses on the concepts, differences, and use cases for groups and tags, helping users understand "why" and "when" to use each. The level is Basic, as it is aimed at non
