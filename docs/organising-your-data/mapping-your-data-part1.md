# Mapping your data to CiviCRM

## Introduction

Moving your organization’s data into CiviCRM is a key step in getting the most out of the system. This guide walks you through the process of “mapping”—figuring out where each piece of your current data fits within CiviCRM’s structure. Taking time to plan this will save you headaches later and help you report on and use your data effectively.

## Before you start

- **Understand your data sources**: Your data might come from spreadsheets, paper records, or even staff memory. Map each source before importing.
- **Avoid duplication**: Try not to create custom fields for information that CiviCRM already handles, like membership dates or donation amounts.
- **Think ahead**: Consider how you’ll use the data for reporting, communications, and day-to-day work.

## Basic information about your constituents

CiviCRM stores basic details like names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails in default fields. It organizes contacts into three types:

- **Individuals**: People your organization works with.
- **Organizations**: Other nonprofits, companies, or groups.
- **Households**: Families or groups sharing an address.

Each type has fields suited to its purpose. For example, only Individual contacts have a gender field.

## Information specific to your organization

You may collect details unique to your mission, like service areas for organizations or allergies for individuals. For these, you can create custom fields. Before adding a custom field, check if CiviCRM already has a suitable field or feature.

## Relationships between constituents

Relationships connect contacts—for example, “employer–employee” or “parent–child.” You can also create custom relationship types (like “volunteer–coordinator”). Relationships help you build a fuller picture of your community.

## Activities

Activities record interactions with your constituents, like phone calls, emails, or meetings. Many actions in CiviCRM (such as recording a donation or event attendance) automatically create an activity. You can add custom activity types if needed.

## Events, memberships, and contributions

- **Events**: Use CiviEvent to manage webinars, meetings, and performances. Map past event attendance to the Events module.
- **Memberships**: CiviMember handles structured membership programs. Map start dates, types, and dues paid—avoid creating duplicate fields.
- **Contributions**: All money, goods, or services received go here. You can specify the type, date, and form of each contribution.

## Campaigns

Campaigns tie together fundraising, communications, and events around a specific goal (like a year-end appeal). Use campaigns if your work fits into themed, time-limited initiatives.

## Grouping and tagging

Groups and tags help you organize contacts for communications and reporting. Groups can be mailing lists or mark shared characteristics. Tags are like keywords for quick categorization. Use smart groups to automatically include contacts that meet certain criteria.

## Profiles

Profiles are sets of fields used for editing or displaying data to staff or website visitors. They don’t change how data is stored, just how it’s shown or collected.
