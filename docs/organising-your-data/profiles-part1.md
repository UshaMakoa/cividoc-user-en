# Getting started with CiviCRM profiles

CiviCRM Profiles are a flexible tool that let you collect, display, and update information from your database—perfect for nonprofits managing members, volunteers, donors, and events. This guide walks you through the basics of setting up and using Profiles, with clear, step-by-step instructions for common tasks.

## What are profiles and why use them?

A Profile is a custom set of fields from your CiviCRM database. You can use Profiles to:

- **Collect information** from your supporters, like volunteer sign-ups or event registrations.
- **Display information** publicly, such as a searchable member directory.
- **Simplify data entry** for staff by showing only the fields they need.
- **Update many records at once**, like marking all event attendees as “Attended.”
- **Manage email lists** by letting people sign up for your newsletters directly from your website.

Profiles can be used on your website, in emails, or within CiviCRM itself. You choose which fields to include, how they’re labeled, and who can see or edit them.
