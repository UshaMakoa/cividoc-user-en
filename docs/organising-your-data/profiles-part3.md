# Using profiles for everyday tasks

Here are some common ways nonprofits use Profiles, with simple instructions for each.

## Create a volunteer sign-up form

1. **Create a Profile** with fields like First Name, Last Name, Email, and a custom field for volunteer interests.
2. **Embed the Profile** on your website or share the link in an email.
3. **New volunteers** fill out the form, and their information is saved directly in CiviCRM.

## Build a member directory

1. **Create a Profile** with fields you want to display (e.g., Name, City, Membership Type).
2. **Set visibility** to Public Pages or Public Pages and Listings.
3. **Choose which fields** are searchable and appear in results.
4. **Share the directory link** on your website so members can find and connect with each other.

## Update multiple records at once

1. **Run a search** in CiviCRM (e.g., find all event attendees).
2. **Select “Update multiple contacts”** (or participants, contributions, etc.).
3. **Choose your Profile**—it should only include fields you want to update.
4. **Edit the fields** for all records on one screen, or use the copy icon to set the same value for everyone.
5. **Save your changes**.

## Manage email lists

1. **Add Group fields** to your Profile to let people opt in to your newsletters.
2. **Visitors check the boxes** for the lists they want to join when they submit the form.
3. **They’re automatically added** to the selected groups in CiviCRM.
