# Understanding profiles in CiviCRM

## What is a profile?

A **profile** in CiviCRM is a collection of fields (like name, email, or custom questions) from your database that you can use to collect, display, or update information. Profiles are flexible and can be used in many ways to help your organisation manage data more easily.

## Why use profiles?

Profiles help you:
- **Collect information**: Create forms for event sign-ups, volunteer registrations, or surveys.
- **Display information**: Show searchable directories (like a member list) on your website.
- **Simplify data entry**: Make it easier for staff or volunteers to enter only the information that matters.
- **Update multiple records**: Quickly change information for many contacts at once.
- **Manage email lists**: Let people sign up for newsletters or updates using checkboxes.

## How do profiles work?

- You choose which fields to include in a profile—these can be standard CiviCRM fields or custom fields you’ve created.

- Profiles can be used on public pages, in event or contribution forms, or internally for staff.

- You decide which fields are required, what they’re called, and who can see or edit them.

## Examples of using profiles

- A **volunteer sign
-up form** with fields for name, address, and interests.

- An **event registration form** that asks about dietary needs.

- A **public member directory** that updates automatically as new members join.

- A **newsletter sign
-up form** that adds people to your email groups.

## Planning your profiles

Before creating a profile, think about:
- **What information do you need?**
- **Who will use the profile?** (Public visitors, staff, or both)
- **Where will it be used?** (Website, event form, internal data entry)

- Some combinations of fields are not allowed, so plan carefully and be ready to adjust as needed.

## Key things to remember

- Profiles can include most types of fields, but some uses have limits (for example, search views can only use contact fields).

- You can set up profiles to add new contacts to groups, notify staff when forms are submitted, or redirect users to a thank
-you page.

- Use advanced settings for extra features like spam protection (reCAPTCHA), mapping, or proximity search.
