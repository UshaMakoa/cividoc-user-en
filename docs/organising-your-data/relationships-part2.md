# Customizing relationship types and fields

## When to create a new relationship type

Create a new relationship type when you need to track a connection that isn’t covered by the built-in options. For example, if you work with volunteers and want to track “Mentor of” and “Mentee of” relationships, you can add these as custom types.

## Steps to create a relationship type

- Go to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Relationship Types**.
- Review existing types to avoid duplication.
- Click **New Relationship Type**.
- Enter clear labels for both directions of the relationship.
- Select the appropriate contact types for each side of the relationship.
- Add a description to help others understand the purpose.
- Click **Save**.

## Editing and managing relationship types

You can edit, disable, or delete relationship types at any time. Disabling a type hides it from new relationships but keeps existing data. Deleting removes it entirely—use this option with caution.

## Adding custom fields to relationships

Custom fields let you store additional information about relationships. For example, you might add a field for “Department” on employee–employer relationships.

- Go to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Custom Fields**.
- Create a new field group for relationships if one doesn’t exist.
- Add your custom field and assign it to the appropriate relationship types.
- Save your changes.

## Best practices

- **Keep labels clear and consistent** so everyone understands what each relationship type means.
- **Use descriptions** to explain the purpose of custom types and fields.
- **Review and clean up** unused relationship types periodically to keep your system tidy.
