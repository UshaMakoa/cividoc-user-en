# Understanding activities in CiviCRM

## What are activities?

**Activities** are records in CiviCRM that track interactions between your organisation and your contacts, such as meetings, phone calls, emails, or any other engagement. Activities provide a central place to see the history of your organisation’s relationships with supporters, clients, and partners.

- Each activity happens at a specific date and time.

- Activities always involve at least one contact, but can include several people.

- Activities can be assigned to staff or volunteers, and CiviCRM can automatically email the assignee.

- If you want to keep track of who did a task, record it as an activity.

## Why use activities?

- Activities help you keep a detailed record of all the ways your organisation interacts with people.

- They are used by different parts of CiviCRM (like contributions, events, petitions) to record when something happens.

- Recording activities makes it easier to follow up, report on engagement, and plan future actions.

## How do activities relate to groups and events?

- **Groups** are used for organising contacts, while **activities** record specific actions or communications.

- For example, sending a membership packet could be tracked by adding the contact to a group, but it’s often better to record it as an activity so you know when it was sent, who sent it, and can add notes.

- **Events** are occasions that contacts attend (like a training or fundraiser). Activities can include event attendance, but also cover a wider range of interactions.

## What information does an activity include?

By default, each activity records:

- **Date and time**: When the activity happened.
- **Duration**: How long it took.
- **Status**: Whether it’s scheduled, completed, cancelled, etc.
- **Added by**: Who created the activity.
- **Assigned to**: Who is responsible for the activity.
- **With contact(s)**: The people involved in the activity.
