# Activity fields and options

## Standard activity fields

When you create or view an activity, youâ€™ll see these standard fields:

- **Date and time**: The scheduled or actual time of the activity.
- **Duration**: How long the activity took.
- **Status**: The progress or outcome (see below for options).
- **Added by**: The user who created the activity.
- **Assigned to**: The person responsible for the activity.
- **With contact(s)**: The contacts involved.

## Activity status options

The default status options for activities are:

- Scheduled

- Completed

- Cancelled

- Left message

- Unreachable

- Not required

Administrators can add more status options if needed, but all statuses will appear for all activity types.

## Repeating activities

You can set up an activity to repeat on a schedule, such as every week or month.

- Choose a start date and time.

- Set how often it repeats (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

- Select which days of the week it repeats on.

- Choose when the series ends (after a certain number of times, or on a specific date).

- You can exclude specific dates from the series.

Each repetition creates a separate activity, which you can edit or delete individually. If you edit one activity in the series, you can apply changes to just that activity, all future activities, or the whole series. Changing the date or time only affects the selected activity.
