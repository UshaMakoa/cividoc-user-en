# How to record an activity in CiviCRM

## Getting started

Recording an activity is a straightforward way to keep track of your organization’s interactions with contacts. Follow these steps to add a new activity.

## Steps to record an activity

1. **Go to the contact record** of the person (or organization) you interacted with.
2. **Click the “Actions” button** (usually near the top of the contact record) and select **New Activity**.
3. **Choose the activity type** that best matches the interaction (for example, Meeting, Phone Call, or Email).
4. **Enter the date and time** when the activity happened.
5. **Add a subject** that briefly describes the activity (for example, “Monthly check-in call”).
6. **Add details** in the description field if you want to record notes or outcomes.
7. **Set the status** (for example, Completed, Scheduled, or Cancelled).
8. **Assign the activity** to the staff member or volunteer responsible.
9. **Add other contacts** in the “With Contact” field if more people were involved.
10. **Click Save** to record the activity.

## Tips

- **Repeating activities**: If this is a recurring task, use the “Repeat Activity” option to automatically create future instances.
- **Custom fields**: If your organization uses custom fields for activities, fill those in as well.
- **Reporting**: Activities you record can be included in reports to help you understand your team’s work and impact.

By following these steps, you’ll build a clear, searchable record of your organization’s interactions—making it easier to stay organized and demonstrate your impact.
