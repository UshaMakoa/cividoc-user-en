# Getting permission to use CiviMail

Before you can create or send mailings in CiviMail, your user account needs the correct permissions.

Understanding who can use CiviMail and how access works helps keep your organisation's communications secure and well managed.

## Why permissions matter

CiviMail allows you to send messages to large groups of contacts.

To protect your data and prevent accidental or unauthorised mailings, access should only be granted to people who understand your organisation's communication policies.

Administrators can assign permissions so that different users can:

- Create and send mailings  
- Use saved templates  
- Access mailing reports  
- Manage or view mailing groups  

If you don't see the **Mailings** option in your menu, ask your system administrator to check your permissions.

## Recommended access levels

For small teams, you might have:

- **Administrators** who manage configuration and deliverability settings  
- **Communications staff** who prepare and send campaigns  
- **Support staff** who can view reports but not send mailings  

Each organisation can adapt this to suit its size and structure, but permissions should always reflect the user's level of responsibility.

## Training and supervision

Before granting mailing access, ensure that users:

- Understand how CiviMail works  
- Know how to test mailings safely  
- Are familiar with data protection and unsubscribe rules  

A short internal checklist or onboarding session can prevent costly mistakes later.

## Best practice

- Keep the number of users with send permission small.  
- Regularly review who has access to CiviMail.  
- Use clear job titles or roles in your permissions list so it's easy to track who can send.
