# Analysing and reporting on your mailings

Once you've sent a mailing, the next step is to understand how it performed.

CiviMail provides detailed reports that help you measure delivery, engagement, and unsubscribes — giving you insight into what's working and where to improve.

## Why reporting matters

Analysing your results helps you make evidence-based decisions.

By reviewing how supporters interact with your emails, you can:

- Identify which messages generate the most engagement  
- Understand when and how your audience prefers to be contacted  
- Spot issues with deliverability or content  
- Improve future campaigns based on real data  

Consistent reporting turns email activity into learning opportunities for your organisation.

## Accessing your mailing reports

To access your reports:

1. Go to **Mailings → Scheduled and Sent Mailings**.  
2. Find the mailing you want to review.  
3. Click the **Report** link next to it.

Each report provides an overview of delivery results and engagement statistics.

## Understanding the key metrics

CiviMail reports include several key figures:

- **Total Sent** — the number of emails successfully sent to recipients.  
- **Delivered** — the number of messages that reached inboxes (not bounced).  
- **Opened** — how many recipients opened your email at least once.  
- **Clicked** — how many recipients clicked on a link inside your message.  
- **Bounced** — the number of emails that could not be delivered.  
- **Unsubscribed** — the number of people who opted out after receiving the email.  

These numbers together give a snapshot of how your campaign performed.

## Viewing engagement detail

You can explore who opened, clicked, or unsubscribed from a mailing.

In the report, use the links next to each figure (for example, "View opened emails") to see the list of contacts involved.

This detail can help you:

- Identify your most engaged supporters  
- Follow up with contacts who clicked specific links  
- Review contacts who unsubscribed to understand patterns or topics that caused disengagement  

Always handle this data responsibly and in line with your organisation's privacy policies.

## Comparing campaigns over time

Looking at one mailing in isolation is useful, but comparing several campaigns shows trends.

You can:

- Track engagement rates across newsletters or event invitations  
- See whether changes in content or timing affect response  
- Measure progress as your list grows and improves  

If you run regular newsletters, record your open and click rates in a shared spreadsheet or dashboard to monitor performance month by month.

## Using reports to improve performance

Once you have your data, use it to refine future mailings:

- If open rates are low, experiment with subject lines or send times.  
- If click rates are low, review content and calls to action.  
- If unsubscribe rates are high, consider adjusting frequency or segmentation.  
- If bounce rates are high, clean your mailing list and review sender authentication.  

Small, consistent changes based on data can significantly improve long-term engagement.

## Exporting your report data

If you want to analyse results further, you can export your mailing data as a CSV file.

From the report screen, choose **Export Recipients**, then select the fields you need (email address, status, or engagement activity).

You can open this file in Excel or another spreadsheet tool to create charts, summaries, or comparison reports.

## Best practice

- Review every mailing report within a few days of sending.  
- Keep a record of key metrics for comparison.  
- Focus on trends over time rather than one-off results.  
- Share insights with your team so future campaigns benefit from what you've learned.
