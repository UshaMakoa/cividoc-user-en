# Improving engagement and retention

Healthy mailing lists rely on meaningful communication — not just clean data.

This page explains how to use segmentation and re-engagement strategies to keep supporters active.

## Understanding engagement

Engagement measures how contacts interact with emails through opens, clicks, and replies.

Monitoring engagement helps you identify which messages resonate and who may be losing interest.

## Segmenting your audience

Segment groups by:

- Contact type or membership level  
- Event attendance or donation frequency  
- Communication preferences or topics  
- Geographic area  

Targeted messages feel relevant and reduce unsubscribes.

## Running re-engagement campaigns

To re-engage inactive contacts:

1. Identify who hasn’t opened or clicked within six months.  
2. Send a re-engagement message (e.g., “We’d love to stay in touch”).  
3. Offer a simple preference update option.  
4. Remove unresponsive contacts after repeated attempts.  

## Analysing results

Use **CiviMail reports** to review open/click data.  
Compare results between groups or message styles.

## Maintaining long-term health

- Review engagement data quarterly.  
- Update subject lines and design regularly.  
- Don’t overcommunicate — focus on value.  

## Best practice

- Re-engage before you remove.  
- Celebrate milestones of active supporters.  
- Be authentic and respect contacts’ time.
