# Setting up your sender details and deliverability

Reliable email delivery depends on trusted sender addresses and professional email design.

## Setting sender details

Include:

- A clear **From Name** (organisation or campaign)  
- **From Address** using your domain (e.g., info@yourorg.org)  
- A valid **Reply-To Address** checked regularly  

Consistent sender details strengthen trust and reduce spam tagging.

## Checking default sender settings

Admins can define default sender details for new mailings.  
If mailings bounce or are rejected, request a review of domain setup and defaults.

## Improving deliverability

To increase inbox success:

- Authenticate your domain (SPF, DKIM).  
- Avoid spam triggers in subject lines.  
- Limit large attachments and excessive images.  
- Send only to confirmed opt-in contacts.  

Well-configured authentication boosts reputation and prevents messages going to spam.

## Testing before sending

Before each campaign:

1. Send a test internally.  
2. Confirm display, links, and formatting.  
3. Ensure sender name and address appear correctly.  

## Best practice

- Use one domain for all mail.  
- Clean mailing lists regularly.  
- Review deliverability reports post-campaign.
