# Everyday CiviMail tasks

Once CiviMail is set up, most of your work will involve creating, sending, and reviewing mailings.

This guide walks you through the routine tasks you'll do most often, helping you send effective, professional emails with confidence.

## Creating a new mailing

1. Go to **Mailings → New Mailing**  
2. Enter a descriptive name for your mailing.  
3. Choose the sender (approved address).  
4. Select recipient group or Smart Group.  
5. Click **Continue** to create your message.

**Tip:** Use clear, consistent names for mailings so reports are easier to read later.

## Writing your message

Use the editor to:

- Write email text directly.  
- Add personalisation tokens like `{first_name}`.  
- Insert links and images.  
- Use message templates for branding.  

Keep messages short and focused to improve engagement.

## Sending a test message

Before large sends:

- Click **Send Test** and use internal addresses.  
- Check subject, formatting, and links.  
- Verify unsubscribe/footer tokens appear correctly.

## Scheduling a mailing

You can send **immediately** or **schedule** a future time.

1. Choose **Schedule for Later** during review.  
2. Pick a date/time.  
3. Click **Schedule**.

Timing matters: mid-week and mid-day usually perform best.

## Monitoring progress

Track messages under **Mailings → Scheduled and Sent Mailings**.

View delivery, opens, clicks, and bounces.  
Cancel only before sending starts.

## Reviewing report data

After delivery, review:

- Deliveries and open rate  
- Bounce and unsubscribe totals  
- Click engagement trends  

## Reusing previous mailings

If you send similar updates often:

1. Go to **Scheduled and Sent Mailings**  
2. Choose an old message  
3. Click **Reuse Mailing** 

Then update content and recipients.

## Managing drafts

Unfinished mailings are saved as drafts.

- Go to **Mailings → Draft and Scheduled Mailings**  
- Edit or delete as needed  

## Best practice

- Use clear names and consistent processes.  
- Review each campaign after sending.  
- Clean up old drafts regularly.  
- Refine future emails based on reports.
