# Building and growing your email audience

Healthy mailing lists are built on consent and trust.  
This page explains how to collect opt-ins responsibly, record consent, and manage preferences so supporters stay engaged.

## Why permission matters

Only email people who have clearly agreed to receive your messages.  
Permission-based communication ensures data protection compliance and fosters trust.

## Encouraging opt-ins

To build lists responsibly:

- Use clear opt-in forms (no pre-ticked boxes).  
- Explain what type and frequency of messages are sent.  
- Provide privacy details and unsubscribe info.  
- Make opting in informed and voluntary.

Contacts who understand expectations are more engaged.

## Recording consent

Always record how and when each consent was given:

- Date and source of agreement (form, event, etc.).  
- Channel or topics subscribed to.  

Use custom fields or notes in contact records.

## Managing preferences

Allow contacts control over communication by:

- Offering topic-based subscription or preference pages.  
- Allowing updates to profile info without unsubscribing.  
- Sending occasional “stay in touch” confirmation emails.

Respectful management reduces unsubscribes and maintains engagement.

## Best practice

- Focus on quality of subscribers over quantity.  
- Review consent records regularly.  
- Provide transparent privacy messages on forms.  
- Offer simple ways to modify communication preferences.
