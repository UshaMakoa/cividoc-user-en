# Designing email templates in CiviMail

Email templates make messages professional, consistent, and fast to produce.

They reflect your organisation’s brand while saving staff time.

## Why use templates

Templates are great for:

- Newsletters  
- Event invitations  
- Campaign updates  
- Donation appeals  

They ensure consistency in design, branding, and tone.

## Creating a template

1. Go to **Mailings → Message Templates**  
2. Click **Add Message Template**  
3. Name it clearly (*e.g.*, “Monthly Newsletter”)  
4. Choose **Mailing** type  
5. Enter subject and content  
6. Include organisation contact/footer  

## Layout and content

A complete layout should have:

- Header with logo/org name  
- Intro line  
- 1–2 short sections  
- Call to action (link/button)  
- Footer with contact details  

Ensure images are small and mobile-friendly.

## Using the rich text editor

You can:

- Add formatting and tokens `{first_name}`  
- Insert links, tables, or images  
- Preview messages  

HTML users can switch to code view.

## Personalisation

Use tokens like `{first_name}` and `{membership_end_date}` for relevance.

## Saving and sharing

Templates can be reused, edited, or copied.

Agree on folder names or naming conventions for clarity.

## Testing

Send a test to internal emails before live use.

Confirm layout, images, and links work.

## Best practice

- Keep design clean and consistent.  
- Limit images and links.  
- Include alt text for accessibility.  
- Review templates regularly.
