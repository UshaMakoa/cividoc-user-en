Suggestion: This page is a Reference, as it is a systematic, factual list of terms for quick look
-up, not a step-by-step guide or explanation. The level is Basic, as it is designed for users learning terminology, and it logically belongs in the Appendices section. If the glossary grows too long, consider splitting into subpages by topic (e.g., "CiviCRM Components Glossary", "Technical Terms Glossary") for easier navigation by non-experts. -->
