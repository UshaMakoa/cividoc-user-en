(If your documentation includes detailed, task-oriented instructions—for example, “How to add a new contact” or “How to send a mass email”—those should be separate **Guide** pages, written for users who already understand the basic terms and are ready to accomplish specific tasks[1][3][4].)

**Style note**:  
All titles and section headers use sentence case. Language is inclusive, encouraging, and avoids jargon unless clearly defined. Explanations use practical examples relevant to non-profit work.
