# Free software and your organisation

## What is free software?

**CiviCRM is Free Software.** This means you can use it for free, share it, and even change it to fit your organisation’s needs. Free Software (sometimes called Free and Open Source Software, FLOSS, FOSS, Software Libre, or Open Source) is software that anyone can download, use, and modify.

You may never need to change the software yourself, but the important thing is that you have the *freedom* to do so if you want. This freedom offers several benefits:

- **CiviCRM is here to stay:** Unlike some paid software that might disappear if a company closes or changes direction, Free Software like CiviCRM is supported by a community. It won’t just vanish.
- **No hidden costs or restrictions:** You can use and customise CiviCRM without paying license fees or worrying about sudden changes to what you’re allowed to do.
- **Customise to fit your needs:** If you want a new feature, you can hire someone to build it, or request it from the community.
- **Anyone can fix problems:** If there’s a bug, anyone with the right skills can fix it. This makes the software more reliable over time.
- **Community-driven development:** Users and organisations can help shape the future of CiviCRM by suggesting improvements or contributing code.

## What do “free software” and “open source” mean?

- **Free software** is software you can use, study, change, and share with almost no restrictions. The main rule is that these freedoms must be preserved for everyone who uses the software in the future.
- **Open source software** is software for which the source code (the instructions that make it work) is available to everyone. You can use, change, and share it, often developed in a public, collaborative way.

Most software that is “free” is also “open source,” and vice versa. The main difference is that “free software” focuses on your freedoms, while “open source” highlights the benefits of sharing and improving the code.

When you install CiviCRM, you won’t see a long, restrictive license agreement. Instead, CiviCRM uses a simple, generous license (the Affero General Public License version 3.0) that protects your rights to use and adapt the software.

## Why does free software matter for non-profits?

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) like CiviCRM is especially valuable for non-profits:

- **Community involvement:** FOSS projects encourage users to help design and improve the software. This means CiviCRM is shaped by real-world needs and experiences from other non-profits.
- **Independence:** You are not locked into one vendor. If you need something special, you can hire any developer to help, and you can share improvements with others.
- **Stability and continuity:** If a company behind a paid software product disappears, you may have to start over. With FOSS, the community can keep the project alive, so your organisation isn’t left stranded.
- **Shared values:** Many non-profits and FOSS communities share values like openness, collaboration, and sharing. By contributing to CiviCRM, you help strengthen the whole non-profit sector.
