# Understanding free and open source software and CiviCRM

## What is free and open source software?

Free and open source software (FOSS) is software that anyone can use, share, and modify without restriction. This means you can download CiviCRM for free, use it for any purpose, and even change it to better suit your needs—though most non-profits use it as-is. The “free” in free software refers to freedom, not just price: you have the freedom to control the software, not the other way around[5].

CiviCRM is developed by a global community, not a single company. This community approach helps ensure the software keeps improving and doesn’t disappear if a company stops supporting it. You’ll never face a sudden license change or lose access to features you rely on.

## Why does this matter for non-profits?

For non-profits, using FOSS like CiviCRM means more than saving money. It means independence and flexibility. If you need a feature that isn’t available, you can hire a developer to build it—something usually impossible with proprietary software. If you find a bug, you or someone you hire can fix it, because the source code is open for anyone to inspect and improve.

Being part of the CiviCRM community also means you benefit from the collective experience of other non-profits. Your feedback and contributions help shape the software, making it more useful for everyone. If the main organisation behind CiviCRM were to change focus, the community could keep the project going—there’s no single point of failure.

## Shared values

There’s a natural alignment between the values of the non-profit sector and the FOSS community. Both believe in collaboration, transparency, and making tools accessible to all. By using and contributing to CiviCRM, you’re helping to strengthen the entire non-profit ecosystem.

## Key points to remember

- **CiviCRM is free to use, share, and modify**—you’re in control.
- **Your organisation can customise CiviCRM** to meet your unique needs.
- **The community ensures CiviCRM’s future**—it won’t disappear if a company changes direction.
- **You’re part of a global network** of non-profits and advocates sharing knowledge and solutions.
