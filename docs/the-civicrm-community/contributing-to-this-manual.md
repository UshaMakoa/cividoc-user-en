# Contributing to this guide

## Introduction

This page helps you learn how to contribute to the CiviCRM user guide. Whether you want to fix a small typo or add detailed instructions, these steps will guide you through the process.

## Preparing to contribute

Before you start, you need to create an account on the CiviCRM community site and log in. This account lets you access the documentation files and submit your changes.

## Making a single change

If you want to make a small edit, such as fixing a spelling mistake or clarifying a sentence, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the CiviCRM documentation site.
2. Find the page you want to edit.
3. Click the pencil icon next to the page title.
4. Make your changes in the online editor.
5. Write a short message describing your changes.
6. Submit your changes for review.

A member of the documentation team will check your edit and publish it once approved.

## Making multiple changes

For larger updates, like adding new sections or reorganizing content, use this process:

1. Log in and create a personal copy (called a "fork") of the documentation repository.
2. Download the files to your computer using a Git client.
3. Find the Markdown file that matches the page you want to edit.
4. Make your changes locally and save them.
5. Upload your changes back to your forked copy.
6. Create a "merge request" to propose your changes to the main documentation.
7. Add a clear description of your changes and submit the request.

The documentation team will review your work and merge it into the official guide when ready.

## Additional resources

If you want to learn more about how CiviCRM documentation works or how to use Markdown formatting, check the developer documentation for detailed guidance.

## Versioning

Always make your edits based on the latest version of CiviCRM by working on the master branch. This ensures your contributions match the current software.

## Style guide

Please follow the CiviCRM documentation style guide when writing or editing content. This helps keep the guide clear, consistent, and easy to understand for everyone.

## Getting help

If you have questions or need support while contributing, you can ask for help in the CiviCRM community chat or forums.
