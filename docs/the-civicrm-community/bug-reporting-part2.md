# How to write a clear bug report for CiviCRM

## Introduction

Writing a good bug report helps the CiviCRM community understand and fix your issue quickly. This tutorial walks you through the process, with a sample template you can use.

## Step 1: Gather your information

Before you start, collect these details:

- **CiviCRM version** (e.g., 5.65.1)
- **CMS platform and version** (e.g., Drupal 9.5, WordPress 6.2)
- **Browser and version** (e.g., Chrome 115, Firefox 117)
- **PHP and MySQL versions** (ask your technical team if you’re not sure)
- **Steps to reproduce the issue** (what you did, step by step)
- **What you expected to happen**
- **What actually happened**
- **Screenshots** (if possible)
- **Any error messages** (copy the exact text)

## Step 2: Try to recreate the issue

If possible, try to make the problem happen again, following the same steps. Note whether it happens every time or only sometimes.

## Step 3: Use the demo site

If you can, recreate the issue on a CiviCRM demo site that matches your version. Note whether the problem happens there too.

## Step 4: Write your report

Use this template to structure your bug report:

```
**CiviCRM version:**  
**CMS platform and version:**  
**Browser and version:**  
**PHP and MySQL versions:**  

**Steps to reproduce:**  
1.  
2.  
3.  

**Expected result:**  
**Actual result:**  

**Screenshots:** [attach if possible]  
**Error messages:**  

**Can you recreate this on the demo site?** Yes/No  
**How often does this happen?** Always/Sometimes/Never  

**Additional notes:**  
```

## Step 5: Submit your report

Post your report on the CiviCRM Q&A site or, if directed, the issue tracker. The community will review it and let you know if they need more information.

## Practice example

Try writing a sample bug report using the template above. Imagine you tried to add a new contact, but the page showed an error instead. Fill in the details as if this happened to you.

## Next steps

After submitting your report, check back for responses. You might be asked for more details—this is normal and helps get your issue fixed faster.
