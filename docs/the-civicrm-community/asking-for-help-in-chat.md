# Asking for help in chat

## Give detailed information

When you ask a question in CiviCRM chat, provide as much detail as you can. For example, instead of saying "I can't install CiviCRM," say "When I try to install CiviCRM, I see error XYZ on screen." Include details like:

- The version of CiviCRM you are using

- The CMS (such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla) and its version

- Any special configuration (for example, if you use caching systems like Memcache or Redis)

- If you have discussed your issue before on CiviCRM Stack Exchange, include a link to that conversation

This helps others understand your problem and provide accurate answers.

## Share your research and what you have tried

Before posting, search online to see if your question has already been answered, especially in the CiviCRM documentation or on CiviCRM Stack Exchange.

When you ask, mention what you have already tried. For example, "I read the docs and followed steps X, Y, and Z, but when I do Y I don't see the expected screen." This helps others avoid repeating suggestions and gives them a clear starting point.

## Use the right chat channel

Choose the appropriate channel for your question:

- **~user-support**: For questions about using CiviCRM
- **~dev-newcomers**: For new developer support
- **~town-square**: If you are unsure where to ask

Do not post the same question in multiple channels.

## Practice good chat etiquette

- Be patient; the community is helpful but may be busy. If you do not get an answer, check back later or try posting on CiviCRM Stack Exchange.

- Ask one question at a time.

- Use MatterMost's reply feature to keep your issue in a single thread. This makes it easier for others to help and follow the conversation. (Shortcut: Shift+Up Arrow to reply.)

- Avoid sending direct messages unless you have checked with the person first. Public discussions help everyone in the community.
