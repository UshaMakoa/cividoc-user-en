# asking for help in chat

## before you ask
When asking for help in CiviCRM's chat channels, it's important to make your question as clear and detailed as possible. This increases the likelihood of getting a helpful response from the community. Here are some tips to help you ask better questions:

- **Be Descriptive**: Instead of asking vague questions like "I can't install CiviCRM," provide specific details such as "When I try to install CiviCRM, I see error XYZ on the screen."
- **Provide Context**: Include information about your setup, such as the version of CiviCRM you're using, the CMS (Content Management System) version, and any caching systems like Memcache or Redis.
- **Link to Previous Conversations**: If you've discussed the issue elsewhere, like on [https://civicrm.stackexchange.com](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com), include a link to that conversation to save time and avoid repetition.

## research before asking
Before posting your question, take a moment to:

- **Search Existing Resources**: Look through the official CiviCRM documentation at [https://docs.civicrm.org](https://docs.civicrm.org) and check if similar questions have been asked on [https://civicrm.stackexchange.com](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com).
- **Share What You've Tried**: Mention any steps you've taken or solutions you've attempted, as this helps responders provide more targeted advice.

## etiquette for asking questions
To ensure your question is seen and answered effectively:

- **Choose the Right Channel**: Post your question in the appropriate channel:
  - ~user-support for using CiviCRM
  - ~dev-newcomers for new developer support
  - ~town square if you're unsure
- **Avoid Duplicate Posts**: Don't post the same question in multiple channels.
- **Be Patient**: The community is helpful but busy, so if no one answers immediately, check back later or try posting on [https://civicrm.stackexchange.com](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com).
- **Ask One Question at a Time**: Focus on a single issue per post to keep the conversation organized.
- **Use Threading**: Use MatterMost's reply feature to keep your issue in a single thread, making it easier for others to follow and assist.
- **Avoid Direct Messages**: Unless you have permission, keep support discussions in public channels to benefit the community.

This guide should help you navigate the CiviCRM chat channels effectively and get the support you need.
