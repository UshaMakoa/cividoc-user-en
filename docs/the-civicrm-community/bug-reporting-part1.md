# Reporting and troubleshooting issues in CiviCRM

## Before you report a bug

If something in CiviCRM isn’t working as you expect, don’t worry—this happens to everyone at some point. Start by searching the CiviCRM Q&A site for similar issues. Often, someone else has already found a solution. If your question hasn’t been answered, feel free to post it yourself. When you do, include details like your CiviCRM version, CMS platform, browser, and a clear description of what you tried and what went wrong. This helps others help you faster.

If you’re using an older version of CiviCRM, consider upgrading. The community supports the latest versions best, and many bugs are fixed in newer releases.

## Common causes of problems

CiviCRM issues can come from several sources. Before reporting a bug, check these common areas:

- **Documentation:** Sometimes, the issue is a misunderstanding. Review the relevant documentation carefully—it’s easy to miss a step when you’re frustrated.
- **Server setup:** Your server’s configuration can affect how CiviCRM works. Changes here might cause unexpected behavior.
- **Software versions:** Using outdated or unsupported versions of CiviCRM, PHP, or MySQL can lead to errors. Always use the latest stable versions.
- **Custom code:** If your site has custom code or modifications, these might be the source of the problem.
- **Other modules:** Newly installed or updated modules or extensions can sometimes conflict with CiviCRM.
- **Actual bugs:** If you’ve checked everything else, you might have found a genuine bug. Reporting it helps improve CiviCRM for everyone.

## Testing your issue on a demo site

To help identify whether the problem is with CiviCRM itself or your specific setup, try to recreate the issue on a CiviCRM demo site that matches your version. If the bug appears there, it’s likely an issue with the core software. If not, the problem might be related to your server, customizations, or other local factors.

Some issues—like those involving email or payments—can’t be tested on a demo site. In these cases, include as much detail as possible about your environment when asking for help.

## Writing a helpful bug report

A good bug report makes it much easier for others to understand and fix the issue. Include:

- **What you did:** The steps you took that led to the problem.
- **What you expected:** What you thought would happen.
- **What actually happened:** The result you saw.
- **Your software versions:** CiviCRM, CMS, browser, PHP, and MySQL versions.
- **Screenshots:** If possible, include images of any error messages or unexpected behavior.
- **History:** How often the bug occurs and under what conditions.
- **Reproducibility:** Can others recreate the issue? Does it happen every time, or only sometimes?

## What happens after you report a bug

Once a bug is reported, the CiviCRM community will review it. Simple bugs might be fixed quickly, while complex ones could take longer. You can usually get the fix by upgrading to the latest version of CiviCRM. If you’re comfortable with technical tasks, you might apply a patch yourself; otherwise, ask your technical support for help.
