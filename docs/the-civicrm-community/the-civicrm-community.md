# The CiviCRM community

## What is the CiviCRM community?

CiviCRM is shaped and improved by a diverse group of users, developers, and implementers from around the world. The community helps make CiviCRM better for everyone and is especially important for non-profit organisations like yours. By joining in, you can get help, share ideas, and support others.

## Finding the community online

Most community activity happens online, so you can participate from anywhere if you have Internet access. English is the main language used.

- **CiviCRM website**: Start here to find news, events, and ways to get involved.
- **CiviCRM Stack Exchange**: Ask questions and find answers about installing, using, and customizing CiviCRM. Many questions have already been answered, and you can help others by sharing your own experiences.
- **CiviCRM Chat (Mattermost)**: Join live discussions, ask technical questions, and connect with other users.
- **CiviCRM blog**: Read posts from the core team and community members about news, events, case studies, and new features. You can comment and even contribute your own posts by contacting info@civicrm.org.

## Finding the community offline

Meeting other CiviCRM users in person can be rewarding.

- **Meetups**: Local gatherings for learning, sharing, and networking.
- **Training sessions**: User and developer training events in various cities.
- **CiviCon**: Larger conferences for users, administrators, and developers to learn and network.
- **CiviCamp**: One-day events focused on learning and connecting.
- **Other conferences**: CiviCRM is also represented at events like DrupalCon and nonprofit technology conferences.

## How you can contribute

There are many ways your organisation can help the CiviCRM community:

- **Contribute to documentation**: Help improve guides and resources for everyone.
- **Share your experiences**: Write case studies or blog posts about how you use CiviCRM.
- **Share training materials**: Post resources to help others learn.
- **Register your organisation**: Add your site to the public directory to help others find you.
- **Contribute code**: Share extensions or improvements you’ve made.
- **Sponsor new features**: Fund development for features your organisation needs.
- **Report bugs**: Help make CiviCRM better by reporting any issues you find.

You don’t need to be an expert to participate—asking questions and sharing your experiences helps the whole community.
