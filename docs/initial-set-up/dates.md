# Managing dates in CiviCRM

## Understanding date localization

In CiviCRM, date and time formats can vary based on your country and language preferences. To set up the appropriate date conventions for your organization, navigate to **Administer > Localization > Date Formats**. This ensures that dates are displayed correctly for your users.

## Date display formats

CiviCRM offers several ways to display dates depending on the context. For example, a report may show dates in a short format (like 09/19/22) to save space, while an event registration form might use a longer format (like September 19th, 2022) for clarity. Here are some common date formats you can customize:

| Format Name               | Example Configuration         | Example Value                   |
