## Troubleshooting common issues

If you encounter issues with address standardization or formatting, consider the following tips:

- **Check your settings**: Ensure that your address settings are configured correctly in CiviCRM.
  
- **Test different addresses**: Not all addresses will validate with USPS. If you receive an error, try using a different address.

- **Contact USPS support**: If you have questions about your Web Tools ID or API access, reach out to the USPS Internet Customer Care Center.

By staying proactive and informed, you can overcome challenges and make the most of the address management features in CiviCRM.
