# Understanding dates in CiviCRM

In this guide, we will explore how to manage dates in CiviCRM effectively. Understanding how to set up and customize date formats is essential for ensuring that your organizationâ€™s data is accurate and easily interpretable.

## Date localization

Date and time conventions can vary significantly depending on your location and language. To ensure that CiviCRM reflects the correct date formats for your needs, navigate to **Administer > Localization > Date Formats**. Here, you can configure the date settings to match your locale.

## Date display

Dates can appear differently based on the context in which they are used. For example, an accounting report may display dates in a compact format (like 09/19/22) to save space, while an event registration form might use a more detailed format (like September 19th, 2022) for clarity.

CiviCRM offers several common date formats, which you can adjust to fit your local preferences. Here are some examples:

| Format Name               | Example Configuration        | Example Value                  |
