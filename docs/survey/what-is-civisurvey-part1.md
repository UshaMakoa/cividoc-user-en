# What is CiviSurvey?

## Introduction to CiviSurvey

CiviSurvey is a feature within CiviCampaign that helps you run offline surveys by letting you record survey responses in a standard way inside CiviCRM. Each survey response is saved as an activity of the type "Survey" linked to an individual contact. This means you use CiviSurvey to collect answers from people already in your contact database.

If you want to collect responses from people who are not yet in your database, you should use the Petition feature instead, which is designed for that purpose.

For organizations using Drupal, CiviSurvey can connect with the Drupal module CiviEngage to offer more survey options.

## How CiviSurvey works in practice: A public housing survey example

Imagine a tenant rights group called Toft Organisation For Tenants (TOFT) wants to understand housing problems in a neighborhood. They meet to decide what questions to ask and who to survey. Then, a staff member creates a survey in CiviCRM and builds a list of respondents from their current contacts.

The staff prints a "walk list" report for volunteers to use when visiting tenants to ask the survey questions. Volunteers collect responses during visits and later enter the answers into CiviCRM activities.

After the survey is complete, the program leader searches for all survey activities and generates reports to analyze the data. This helps TOFT plan their next steps and communicate effectively about tenant issues.

## Key points to remember

- CiviSurvey records responses from existing contacts only.  
- Survey responses are stored as activities linked to each contact.  
- It supports offline data collection, with responses entered later into the system.  
- It integrates with Drupal's CiviEngage module for additional survey features.  
- Use the Petition feature if you need to collect responses from people not yet in your database.

This explanation helps non-profit users understand what CiviSurvey is and how it can support their data collection efforts in a simple, practical way.
