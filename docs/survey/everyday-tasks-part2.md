# Creating and using walklists for surveys

## Creating a walklist report

Walklists are printed address lists for volunteers doing door-to-door surveys.

To create a walklist:

- Go to **Reports > Create Templates from Reports > Survey Report (Detail)**.

- In **Display Columns**, select: Street Number, Street Name, Street Unit, Survey Responses.

- In **Group By Columns**, select: Street Name, Odd/Even Street Number.

- In **Set Filters**, choose your survey name and set **Respondent Status** to *Reserved*.

- Click **Preview Report**, then **Print Preview**.

- Print your report. The printout will include a cover sheet with the survey questions and will be sorted by street name and even/odd street numbers.

*Tip:* For more information about setting up surveys and reports, see the **Set
-up** section in Surveys.

## Conducting your door-knock canvass

Give the walklist report sheets to your volunteers or staff. They can use these sheets to visit each address and collect responses.

## Recording responses from the canvass

After canvassing:

- Go to **Campaigns > Interview Respondents**.

- Enter the survey and group details (and street name, if you want to focus on a smaller area).

- On the search results screen, select the contacts you want to record responses for.

- Click **Go**.

- Enter the responses and results from your walklist sheets.

- Click **Record Response**.

<!--
This content is a Guide because it provides step
-by-step instructions for achieving specific tasks (managing, conducting, and recording surveys), with no conceptual background or exhaustive technical detail. The content is aimed at non-expert users and focuses on practical actions, matching the DiÃ¡taxis definition of a Guide[1][2][6]. The material is basic in level, as it covers everyday, common workflows for non-profit staff. The content could be split further if needed, but the two main workflows (managing/responding and walklist/door-knock) are kept on separate pages for clarity. -->
