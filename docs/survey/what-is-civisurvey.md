# What is CiviSurvey?

## Overview

CiviSurvey is a feature in CiviCRM that helps your organisation run surveys with your existing contacts. It is designed for situations where you want to collect information or feedback from people already in your database, such as members, volunteers, or supporters. Survey responses are saved as activities for each contact, making it easy to track, manage, and report on the results.

If you want to gather responses from people who are *not* in your database, you should use the Petition feature instead.

## How CiviSurvey works

- You create a survey in CiviCRM and choose which contacts to include.

- Volunteers or staff collect responses from these contacts, either in person or by phone.

- Each response is recorded in CiviCRM as a survey activity for the contact.

- You can generate reports to analyse the results and use the findings to guide your organisation’s work.

## Example scenario

A tenants’ rights organisation wants to understand housing conditions in a neighbourhood. They create a survey in CiviCRM, select contacts who live in the area, and print a list for volunteers. Volunteers visit each contact, ask questions, and record answers. Later, these responses are entered into CiviCRM. The organisation then uses reports to see which issues are most urgent and plan their next steps.

## Special notes

- CiviSurvey is for *existing contacts* in your database.

- For Drupal sites, CiviSurvey can work with the CiviEngage module to offer extra options.

- Use the Petition feature if you need to collect responses from new people.
