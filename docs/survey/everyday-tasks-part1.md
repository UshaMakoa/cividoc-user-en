# Managing surveys

## Viewing and editing surveys

To see and manage your surveys:

- Go to **Campaign > Dashboard > Surveys**.

- You will see a summary of your existing surveys.

- Use the links on the right to manage a survey, or click **Add Survey** to create a new one.

## Reserving respondents

Before you conduct a survey, you need to reserve the people you want to interview (called "respondents").

To reserve a group of respondents:

- Go to **Campaigns > Reserve Respondents**.

- In the **Survey** dropdown, select your survey (required).

- In the **Group(s)** dropdown, select the group of contacts to interview.

- You can add more criteria to focus on a geographic area, such as street address, city, or postal code.

*Tip:* If you want to split addresses into street name, number, and unit (helpful for door
-to-door canvassing), turn on address parsing by going to **Administer > Administration Console > Configuration Checklist > Address Settings**, then check the box for *Street Address Parsing*.

- Click **Search**.

- In the search results, select the people you want to reserve (or select all).

- Click **Go** to reserve them.

- On the next screen, click **Reserve**.

## Interviewing respondents

To interview people and record their answers:

- Go to **Campaign > Interview Respondents**.

- Enter the survey and group details, then click **Search**.

- In the results, select the people you want to interview (or select all).

- Click **Go** to start recording responses.

- For each person, record their answers to the survey questions.

- In the **Result** column, select the status (e.g., Completed, No Answer).

- Click **Record Response**.

After recording:

- Click **Done** to return to the search screen.

- Click **Release Respondents** if you want to make these contacts available for others to interview.

- Click **Reserve More Respondents** to find more people to interview.

## Reviewing survey results

After your survey is complete, you can review the results. See the **Reports and analysis** section in the Surveys documentation for details on viewing and analyzing survey data.
