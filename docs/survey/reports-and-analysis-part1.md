# Analyzing Survey Results with CiviCRM

## Introduction
Analyzing survey results is crucial for understanding feedback and making informed decisions. CiviCRM offers powerful tools to help you create and analyze surveys effectively.

## Creating a Survey Report
To analyze survey results, follow these steps:

1. **Access CiviReport**: Go to **Administer** > **CiviReport** and select **Create New Report from Template**.
2. **Choose the Survey Report Template**: Under **Campaign Report Templates**, select **Survey Report (Detail)** or click on a survey name from the survey dashboard.
3. **Configure Report Columns**: On the **Columns** tab, check the boxes for **Survey Responses** and any other fields you want to include in the report, such as **Street Number** and **Street Name**.
4. **Apply Filters**: On the **Filters** tab, select the survey by name and choose the **Respondent Status** (e.g., **Interviewed**). You can also filter by custom data sets of questions.
5. **Preview and Export**: Click **Preview Report** to view the results. You can export the report data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Viewing a Formatted Report
For a more structured report, click **Print Preview**. This will display a formatted report with a cover sheet showing questions and responses, and it can be ordered by criteria such as street names.
