# Scope of the CiviCRM user guide

## What this guide covers

The CiviCRM User Guide is for people who use CiviCRM through its web interface. It explains all the features and tools you can access directly from your browser, helping you get the most out of CiviCRM for your organisation’s day-to-day work.

## How this guide is different from the System Administrator Guide

There is a separate System Administrator Guide. That guide covers tasks like installing CiviCRM, upgrading it, and other technical jobs that usually require special access to your server or files outside the CiviCRM website.

This User Guide focuses on what you can do from inside CiviCRM’s web interface. If a task needs you to use the server or command line, you will find it in the System Administrator Guide instead.

## Searching the documentation

If you want to search all CiviCRM documentation quickly from your dashboard, you can add a special extension called “docbot-extension.” To learn how to install an extension, see the instructions for installing extensions in CiviCRM.

Once installed, this extension adds a search widget to your dashboard, making it easy to find help when you need it.

## Editing and contributing to this guide

The User Guide is created using a tool called MkDocs and is stored in a GitLab repository.

If you want to suggest changes or help improve the guide:
- For simple edits, see the page about contributing to this guide.
- For more detailed instructions, see the writing documentation page in the Developer Guide.

## Credits

This guide is a community effort, written and updated by CiviCRM users and coordinated by the Documentation Working Group.
