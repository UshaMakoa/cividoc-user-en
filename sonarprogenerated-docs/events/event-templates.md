# Event templates

## What are event templates?

**Event templates** let you quickly set up new events in CiviCRM that share the same settings, such as location, fees, or registration options. This is helpful if your organisation runs similar events regularly, so you don’t have to enter the same information each time.

## How to create an event template

1. Go to **Events > Event Templates** in the CiviCRM menu.
2. Click **Add Event Template**.
3. Enter a **template title** that clearly describes the type of event (for example, “Monthly community meetup with online registration”).
4. Choose an **event type**.
5. If all events from this template should be linked to a specific campaign, select the campaign.
6. Fill in any settings that will stay the same for all events using this template. This might include:
   - Location
   - Event fees
   - Online registration settings
   - Tell-a-friend options
7. Save your template.

## How to use an event template

When you create a new event, you can select one of your templates. The event form will automatically fill in with the details you saved, so you only need to add event-specific information like the date and time.
