# Integrating events with your website

## Linking to event registration and information pages

You can promote your organisationâ€™s events by linking directly to your event pages from your website or partner websites. This makes it easier for visitors to find information and register.

To get the link for your event registration or information page:

- Go to **Events > Manage Events** in CiviCRM.
- Click **Event Links** next to your event.
- Copy the URL for either the event info page or the event registration page.

You can now add these links anywhere on your website, such as in news posts, event calendars, or partner sites.

## Adding events in Joomla!

If your website uses Joomla!, you can add a menu item that links directly to a CiviCRM event:

- Open the Joomla! control panel.
- Go to **Menu Manager** and select your menu.
- Click **New** to create a new menu item.
- Expand **CiviCRM > CiviCRM Events** and select **Event Info**.
- On the right, choose your event from the **Select an Event** list.
- Click **Save**.

## Adding events in WordPress

If your website uses WordPress, you can use a CiviCRM shortcode to insert the event registration form directly into a page or post. Look for the CiviCRM icon when editing your content, and select the event registration form you want to display.

## Adding events in Drupal

If your website uses Drupal, you can use the Views module to create lists of upcoming events that update automatically. For more advanced options, see the Drupal integration section in the Website integration chapter.

## Sharing an RSS feed of upcoming events

CiviCRM provides an RSS feed for all your upcoming events. This allows visitors to subscribe to your events or lets other websites display your events automatically.

To get your events RSS feed:

- Go to **Events > Manage Events**.
- Click the orange and white RSS icon at the top right of the page.
- Copy the URL and share it, or embed it into your website.

# comment: This page is a Guide because it provides actionable steps for specific goals (integrating events with a website), not a step-by-step tutorial for beginners, nor reference or explanation content. The level is Basic, as it assumes little prior knowledge. The logical section is Events > Website integration.
