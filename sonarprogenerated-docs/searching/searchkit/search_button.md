# comment: This page is best categorized as Reference because it provides a factual, concise description of a specific UI element (the Search button) and its behavior, without step-by-step instructions or conceptual background. The content is simple and aimed at users needing to look up what the button does, not learn a process or understand underlying concepts. If there were step-by-step instructions on performing a search, that would be a Tutorial or Guide.
