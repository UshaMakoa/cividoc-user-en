# Description field for saved searches

## What is the description field?

The **description** field lets you provide a detailed summary of a saved search in CiviCRM. This is useful if the search title alone does not fully explain what the search does or why it is important for your organisation.

## Why use the description field?

- Helps team members quickly understand the purpose of a saved search.
- Reduces confusion if the title is brief or unclear.
- Makes it easier to share searches with others in your organisation.

## How to use the description field

- When saving a search, look for the **description** box.
- Write a short summary that explains what the search finds and why it matters.
- Use plain language so everyone on your team can understand.

**Example:**  
If your saved search is titled "Active Donors," you might write in the description:  
*"This search lists all donors who have made a contribution in the past 12 months. Used for sending thank-you emails and annual reports."*

# comment: This page is a Reference because it defines a field and its purpose, not a step-by-step process or conceptual background. For non-experts, this should remain a basic reference. If the page included instructions for saving a search, that would be a Tutorial or Guide; if it explained why descriptions matter for reporting, that would be an Explanation.
