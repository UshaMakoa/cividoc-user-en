# Using actions in CiviCRM Search Kit

## What are actions?

Actions are tasks you can perform on the results of a search in CiviCRM’s Search Kit. The available actions depend on what kind of data you are searching (for example, Contacts or Contributions).

## How to select records for actions

- To use most actions, you need to select one or more results from your search.
- You can select individual results by clicking their checkboxes.
- To select all results on the page, click the dark gray box at the top of the results list.
- To select all results (not just those on the current page), use the dropdown arrow next to the selection box and choose the option you need.
- If you don’t select anything, only the “Download Spreadsheet” action will be available.

## What actions can you perform?

- The list of available actions changes depending on the type of data you searched for.
- For example, searching for Contacts will show different actions than searching for Contributions.
- Typical actions include exporting data, updating records, sending emails, or adding contacts to a group.

## Where to find details about each action

- For a description of each available action and what it does, see the documentation section called “Search result actions.”

# comment: Suggestion: This page is a Guide because it focuses on the practical steps and choices for using the Actions feature in Search Kit, not on background, exhaustive options, or theory. The level is Basic because it assumes users are learning the system and need clear, direct instructions. If the “Search result actions” section contains detailed lists of all possible actions, that content should be split into a Reference page for clarity.
