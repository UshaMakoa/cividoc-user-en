# Search For in Search Kit

## What is "Search For"?

The **Search For** option lets you choose the main type of information you want to find using Search Kit. You start every search by picking what you want to search for, such as contacts, contributions, events, or other records.

## Main types you can search for

Here are the main options you can select:

- **Activity**: Actions involving one or more contacts (like meetings, calls, or emails).
- **Contacts**: People, organizations, or households in your database.
- **Contributions**: Financial transactions and donations.
- **Events**: In-person or online events that contacts can register for and attend.
- **Grants**: Funds applied for or given out by your organisation.
- **Individuals**: Contacts that are people (not organizations or households).
- **Memberships**: Records of contacts who are members of your organisation.
- **Organizations**: Contacts that are organizations.
- **Participants**: Records of contacts attending or involved in events.
- **Pledges**: Promises to donate in the future, either all at once or over time.

There are also other, less common types available. Each type comes with a description in the Search Kit to help you pick the right one for your needs.

## What happens after you select a type?

- Once you choose a main type, you can add extra options to refine your search (for example, searching for contacts *with* or *without* certain activities).
- You can also group your results in different ways, depending on the type you selected.

# comment: Suggestion: The content is a concise description of the "Search For" feature and the available entities, making it a Reference page. It presents factual, systematic information without step-by-step instructions or conceptual background. The intended audience is new or non-expert users, so the level is Basic. The logical section is "Searching and reporting > Search Kit". If more step-by-step instructions on how to use "Search For" were needed, a separate Tutorial or Guide could be created.
