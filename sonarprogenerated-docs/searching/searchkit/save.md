# Saved searches in SearchKit

## Overview

Saved searches in SearchKit allow you and your organisation to quickly access and reuse searches you have created. These searches help you find and report on your data without needing to rebuild the search each time.

There are two types of saved searches:

- **Custom searches**: Searches you or other users create for your specific needs.
- **Packaged searches**: Predefined searches that come with SearchKit or are installed from extensions. These usually have the main entity (such as Contacts or Contributions) and useful columns already set up, but you can modify or clone them to suit your needs.

## Creating and saving a new search

When you create a new search in SearchKit, you can save it for later use. This makes it easier for you and others in your organisation to run the same search again.

To save a search:

1. Enter a clear, descriptive title that explains what the search is for.
2. (Optional) Go to “Configure Settings” in the left-side menu to add:
   - A description of the search
   - Tags to help you find it later (for example, by department or staff member)
   - An expiry date if the search is only needed for a certain period
3. Click **Save**.

Once saved, your search appears on the SearchKit landing page, showing its title, description, main entity (such as Contacts or Contributions), tags, and details about who created or last modified it and when.

## Managing saved searches

After saving a search, you can:

- **Edit**: Change most details (such as title, description, tags, expiry date) by clicking the pencil icon next to the search. *Note: You cannot change the main entity of the search after saving. For example, if your search is for Contributions, you cannot switch it to Contacts later.*
- **View results**: See the results of your saved search and take further actions on them.
- **Clone**: Make a copy of a search to create a new variation without starting from scratch.
- **Export**: Copy the search configuration to transfer it between sites or for use in extensions. (For packaging and distribution, see developer documentation.)
- **Delete**: Remove searches you no longer need.
