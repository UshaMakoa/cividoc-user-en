# Title field for saved searches

## What is the “Title” field?

When you save a search in CiviCRM, you need to enter a **Title**. This is a short name that helps you and your team quickly identify the search later.

## How is the title used?

- The title appears as the **Label** on the Saved Search page after you click Save.
- Everyone in your organisation who can view saved searches will see this title.

## Tips for choosing a good title

- Use a clear, descriptive name so anyone can understand what the search does.
- Your organisation might want to use a consistent naming pattern, such as:
  - Start with the department (for example: “Fundraising:”)
  - Or start with the main type of data (for example: “Contributions by Year by Contact”)
- Example: **Fundraising: Contributions by Year by Contact**

# comment: This is a Reference page because it defines a field and its usage, not a step-by-step process or conceptual explanation. The content is factual, concise, and systematic, matching the Diátaxis definition of Reference[2][3][4]. If there were more about naming conventions or examples, those could be spun off into a Guide or Tutorial.
