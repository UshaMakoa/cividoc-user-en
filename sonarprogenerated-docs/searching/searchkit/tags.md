# Using tags in SearchKit

## What are tags?

**Tags** in CiviCRM are labels you can use to organize and categorize your data. In SearchKit, tags help you group and filter your saved searches by topics such as department, project, or initiative.

You can use tags with different types of records, including Contacts, Activities, Cases, Files, and Saved Searches.

## Why use tags in SearchKit?

As your organization creates more saved searches, tags make it easier to find and manage them. On the SearchKit landing page (where all your saved searches are listed), you can use the “Filter by tags…” option in the upper right to quickly narrow down the list by one or more tags.

## How to add tags to a SearchKit search

You can add tags to a search in three ways:
- When creating a new search
- When editing an existing search
- Directly from the Saved Searches main screen

### Steps to add a tag when creating or editing a search

1. Open the search you want to tag, or start a new search.
2. Click **Configure Settings** on the left sidebar.
3. Find the **Tags** box.
4. Click inside the Tags box. You can:
   - Select an existing tag from the list.
   - Type a new tag name and choose to create it if it doesn’t exist.

### Steps to add a tag from the Saved Searches screen

1. Go to the Saved Searches landing page.
2. Find the search you want to tag.
3. Click the tag icon with a down arrow next to the search.
4. In the “Add tag…” field, start typing the tag name.
   - If the tag already exists, select it.
   - If it’s new, select “Create Tag” to add it to CiviCRM (it will be enabled for SavedSearch and can be used elsewhere).

## Tips

- Tags you create for searches can also be used in other parts of CiviCRM, such as Advanced Search.
- Using clear, consistent tag names will help your team stay organized.
