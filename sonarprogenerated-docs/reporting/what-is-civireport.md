# What is CiviReport?

## Overview

**CiviReport** is a feature in CiviCRM that helps your organisation create reports based on the information you have about your contacts and their interactions with you. Reports are useful for evaluating your impact, meeting funder requirements, and making informed decisions.

With CiviReport, you can:
- Create reports using templates that focus on different types of data, such as donations or memberships.
- Run reports on demand to see up-to-date information.
- Add reports to your dashboard for quick access.
- Schedule reports to be sent by email, including as CSV or PDF files, so you can share them with your team or import them into other systems.

## How CiviReport Works

- Reports are built by selecting criteria and fields from templates, making it easy to focus on the information you need.
- You can display reports directly in CiviCRM, add them to your dashboard, or receive them by email on a schedule.
- Reports can be used for follow-up actions, like creating groups for targeted communications or exporting data for accounting.

## Examples of How Organisations Use CiviReport

- **Fundraising**: Identify donors who gave last year but not this year, so you can reach out and encourage them to give again.
- **Financial tracking**: Receive regular reports of payments and upcoming renewals to help with accounting and planning.
- **Household contributions**: View total contributions from all members of a household to answer questions or recognise supporters.

CiviReport is a flexible tool that helps your organisation get the most out of your CiviCRM data.
