# External reporting in civicrm

## Introduction to external reporting

External reporting in CiviCRM involves using tools outside of CiviCRM to analyze and visualize data. This approach is useful when you need to combine data from multiple sources or require more advanced analytics capabilities than what CiviCRM offers internally.

## Why external reporting?

External reporting tools like **Metabase**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** allow you to create complex reports and dashboards by accessing your CiviCRM database directly via MySQL or MariaDB, or through the CiviCRM API. This method is particularly helpful when you want to:

- **Combine data**: Integrate data from multiple applications for a more comprehensive view.
- **Enhance analytics**: Leverage advanced analytics and visualization capabilities not available within CiviCRM.
- **Customize reports**: Create tailored reports that meet specific organizational needs.

## Tools for external reporting

Several tools are available for external reporting, each with its strengths:

- **Metabase**: Known for its ease of use and simple setup, Metabase is ideal for creating quick, interactive dashboards.
- **Tableau**: Offers powerful data visualization and analytics capabilities, making it suitable for complex data analysis.
- **Power BI**: Provides robust reporting and business analytics tools, integrating well with Microsoft products.

## Accessing your data

To use these tools, you need to access your CiviCRM database. This can be done through:

- **Direct database connection**: Connect directly to your MySQL or MariaDB database.
- **CiviCRM API**: Utilize the CiviCRM API to retrieve data without direct database access.

## Next steps

If you lack the necessary skills for setting up external reporting, consider consulting with CiviCRM experts or your organization's IT support team.
