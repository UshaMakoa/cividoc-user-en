# Pledges reports and analysis

## Overview of pledge reports

CiviCRM provides several built-in reports to help your organisation understand and manage pledges. These reports allow you to review details about individual pledges and get summaries for groups of pledges.

### Standard pledge reports

- **Pledge detail report:**  
  Shows information for each contact who has made a pledge. This includes the amount pledged, the status of the pledge, the date of the next payment, the balance due, and the total amount paid so far. This report is based on the "Pledge Report" template.

- **Pledged but not paid report:**  
  Lists all pledges that are not yet completed and have a payment due date in the past. This helps you quickly find pledges that may need follow-up. This report uses the "Pledged But Not Paid" template.

- **Pledge summary report:**  
  You can use the "Pledge Summary Report" template to create a summary of total pledge amounts, such as by city or by the month when the pledge was first made.

### Customizing reports

If the standard reports do not show exactly what you need, you can create a new report using one of the pledge report templates. This allows you to choose which information is included, so the report fits your organisation’s needs.

For more information on creating and customizing reports, see the Reporting Set-up section.
