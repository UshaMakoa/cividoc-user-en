# What is CiviPledge?

## Understanding pledges in CiviCRM

A **pledge** in CiviCRM is a promise from a donor to give a certain amount of money to your organisation, either all at once in the future or spread out over several payments.

For example, a supporter might pledge to donate $3,000 over five years, making monthly payments of $50.

## How pledges work

- Donors can make pledges themselves using your online contribution forms, or your staff can record pledges on their behalf.
- Each pledge acts as an *umbrella* that groups together all the individual payments made towards that promise.
- Payments can be tracked manually (for example, if a donor sends a cheque) or automatically if you use an online payment processor.
- If a donor misses a payment, you can update the pledge status to reflect this.
- You can set up email reminders to automatically notify donors before their payments are due, helping them keep their commitment.

Pledges are a useful way for your organisation to plan for future income and encourage ongoing support from your donors.
