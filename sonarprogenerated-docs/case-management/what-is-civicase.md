# What is CiviCase?

## Understanding CiviCase

**CiviCase** is a tool in CiviCRM that helps your organisation keep track of ongoing interactions and complex processes involving your clients, constituents, or internal teams. You can think of it as a case management system that brings together related activities, tasks, and communications into one organised place.

With CiviCase, you can:
- **Track workflows or procedures** that require multiple steps and involve several staff members.
- **Coordinate staff efforts** and avoid duplicating work by making sure everyone can see what has already been done and what still needs attention.
- **Automate reminders and follow-ups** so important tasks aren’t forgotten.

CiviCase is built around the concept of **Activities**—these are the tasks, calls, meetings, or other actions that make up the steps in your workflow. Understanding how activities work in CiviCRM will help you get the most out of CiviCase.

## Real-world examples

Here are a few ways organisations use CiviCase:

- **Managing constituent requests:**  
  A legislator’s office receives many requests from constituents. Staff can create a case for each issue, assign tasks to the right team member, and track progress. For example, if someone calls about an issue, staff can check the case to see if it’s already being handled and update the constituent accordingly. CiviCase also schedules follow-up activities so nothing is missed.

- **Coordinating complex application processes:**  
  An organisation running a grant programme uses CiviCase to manage each application as a separate case. Different staff and even external partners are assigned activities like initial review, technical assessment, and final approval. Each person sees only the cases and tasks assigned to them, making it easier to focus and stay organised, even when managing thousands of applications.

- **Providing individual support:**  
  In a housing support scenario, a case might be opened for someone seeking help. Activities like medical evaluation, securing temporary housing, and follow-up are scheduled automatically. Different staff roles (like a coordinator or specialist) are assigned as needed.

## Why use CiviCase?

- **Stay organised:** Keep all related information and communications together for each case.
- **Improve teamwork:** Assign tasks and track who is responsible for each step.
- **Save time:** Automated reminders and scheduled activities help you stay on top of deadlines.
- **Scale up:** Handle large numbers of cases efficiently, with dashboards showing each staff member only what’s relevant to them.
