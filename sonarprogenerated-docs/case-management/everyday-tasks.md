# Everyday case management tasks

## Viewing the case dashboard

You can use the **case dashboard** to keep track of your organisation’s cases and related activities. The dashboard shows:

- A summary of cases you’re involved in.
- Upcoming activities scheduled in the next 14 days.
- Recently completed activities from the last 14 days.

If you have permission, you can also view all cases in the system, not just your own. To switch between viewing your cases and all cases, click the link at the top right of the dashboard.

To work on a scheduled activity, click the **edit pencil** next to the activity name. To see all activities for a case, click the triangular expand icon next to the client’s name. From here, you can view or edit any activity. Use the **Manage Case** button to work on several tasks at once, change the case status, print a report, or view case roles.

To add a new case, click the **Add Case** button at the top left.

## Finding cases

To find a specific case, you can:

- Use the full-text search if you know the Case ID.
- Go to **Search > Find Cases** or **Cases** in the menu bar.

You can search by:

- Client’s name or email.
- Case type.
- Case status.
- All cases or just your cases (default is your cases).
- Deleted cases (tick the checkbox).

Combine multiple criteria to narrow your results. For example, searching by client name and case type will show cases matching both.

## Opening a new case

You can open a new case for an existing contact or create a new contact at the same time.

**For an existing contact:**

1. Go to the contact’s summary screen.
2. Select **Add Case** from the Actions menu or click the Cases tab.
3. Fill in the required fields.
4. Click **Save**.

**For a new contact:**

1. Go to **Cases > New Case** or use the **Create New > Case** button.
2. Check if the contact already exists by typing their name or email.
3. If not found, select the contact type to create a new record and fill in their details.

Fill out fields such as **Medium** (how you heard about the case), **Location**, **Details** (overall case info), **Subject** (brief description), **Case Type**, **Case Status**, **Case Start Date**, and **Duration** (time spent collecting info).

After completing the form, click **Save** to create the case and go to the manage case page, or **Save and New** to add another case.

## Managing a case

On the **manage case page**, you can:

- View case summary.
- Change case status or reassign.
- Create or manage activities and timelines.
- Assign case roles.
- Manage client relationships.
- Run case reports.

## Assigning case roles

Assign roles to contacts who are working on or need updates about the case. Their phone and email will be shown for easy communication.

To assign a role:

1. Click the **Case Roles** area.
2. Click the edit icon next to a role.
3. Type the contact’s last name and select from the dropdown.
4. Click **OK**.

To assign multiple contacts to a role, use the **Add New Role** button. If a contact isn’t in the database, add them first under **Contacts > New Individual**.

You can email, edit, or delete case roles. Emails sent here are automatically added to the case activities for tracking.

## Bulk adding contacts to a case with a specific role

To add several contacts to a case:

1. Search for contacts.
2. Select the contacts you want to add.
3. Choose **Add to case as role**.
4. Select the case and role.
5. Click **Submit**.

## Finding activities within a case

To view activities in a case, scroll to the **Case Activities** section. Scheduled activities are listed first, followed by completed ones. Sort by columns or use filters to narrow activities by reporter/role, status, dates, type, or deleted status.

## Adding and managing activities

To add a single activity:

1. Go to the case.
2. Choose an activity type from **New Activity**.
3. Click **Go** and fill out the form.

To add a set of activities (timeline):

1. Go to the case.
2. Choose a timeline or sequence from **New Timeline**.
3. Confirm by clicking **OK**.

To notify case role contacts about an activity, open the **Send a Copy** area and select who should be alerted.

To schedule a follow-up activity, open the **Schedule Follow-up** area, choose the type, set the number of days, enter a subject, and click **Go**.

To add an attachment, open the **Attachments** area, click **Choose file**, select up to five files, and save the activity.

## Editing an activity in a case

To edit:

1. Go to the case.
2. Click **Edit** next to the activity in the table.
3. Make changes and save.

To assign a scheduled task to staff, type their name in **Assigned to** and select from the list. Remove contacts by clicking the X next to their name.

## Updating the status of case activities

To quickly update status:

1. Go to the case.
2. Click the status text in the activity row.
3. Select the new status and click **OK**.

## Changing the status of a case

To change case status:

1. Go to the case.
2. Click **Manage Case**.
3. Click the edit icon next to the current status.
4. Set the new status and update linked cases if needed.
5. Click **Save**.

A new activity is recorded whenever the case status changes, to keep a complete history.

# comment: This page is a Guide, as it provides step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific case management tasks, rather than background, reference, or tutorial content. The level is Basic, as it is aimed at users new to CiviCRM. If needed, sections like "Managing a case" or "Assigning case roles" could be split into their own focused guides for clarity.
