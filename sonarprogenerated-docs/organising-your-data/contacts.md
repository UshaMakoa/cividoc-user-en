# Contacts overview

## What are contacts?

**Contacts** are the core records in CiviCRM. Everything your organisation tracks—such as donations, memberships, or event participation—is linked to a contact. There are three main types of contacts:

- **Individuals**: People, such as supporters, staff, or volunteers.
- **Organisations**: Companies or other non-profit organisations.
- **Households**: Families or groups sharing an address.

Each contact has standard fields, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and communication preferences. You can also add your own custom fields or create subtypes for more specific needs.

## How are contacts organised on screen?

When you view a contact, their information is organised into **tabs**:

- **Summary**: Basic details like names, addresses, and contact methods.
- **Relationships**: Connections to other contacts.
- **Activities**: Interactions, such as meetings, emails, or event attendance.
- **Mailings, Contributions, Memberships, Events**: Details about each type of engagement (these tabs appear if the relevant CiviCRM features are enabled).
- **Groups and Tags**: Categories you use to organise contacts.
- **Notes**: Free-text notes about the contact.
- **Change Log**: Shows who changed what and when.

Tabs appear or disappear depending on which CiviCRM components are enabled and your permissions.

## What actions can you perform with contacts?

At the top of a contact’s record, you’ll find the **Actions** button. This lets you quickly:

- Add a note
- Record a contribution, meeting, or other activity

You can also add, edit, or delete contacts as needed.

## Key contact details

- **Names**: For individuals, you can record prefix, first name, middle name, last name, suffix, and nickname. For organisations, you record the organisation name.
- **Addresses**: Each contact can have multiple addresses (e.g., home, work). You can mark one as primary, share addresses between contacts, and use mapping features if enabled.
- **Phone numbers and emails**: Store multiple phone numbers and email addresses, and mark one as the primary for bulk mailings.
- **Communication preferences and privacy options**: Specify how contacts prefer to be reached and respect their privacy choices (e.g., do not email, do not phone).
- **Greetings and addressees**: CiviCRM can generate greetings like “Dear Jenny” automatically, which you can customise.

## Organising and customising contacts

- **Contact subtypes**: Create subtypes (like “Student” or “Teacher”) based on the main contact types to better organise your data.
- **Custom fields**: Add fields specific to your organisation’s needs.
- **Customising the view**: Hide or rearrange fields and sections to simplify the contact screen for your users.

## Adding, editing, and deleting contacts

- **Adding**: Use the Contacts menu to create new individuals, organisations, or households. Required fields are marked, and you can check for duplicates.
- **Editing**: Click the edit link in any section or use the main edit button to update details.
- **Deleting**: Delete a contact to move it to the trash (from where it can be restored if needed).

# comment: This page is best classified as Reference: it systematically describes what contacts are, their fields, types, and how they are organised and managed in CiviCRM, without step-by-step instructions or in-depth conceptual background. It is suitable for users needing a factual overview and quick look-up. If more detailed procedures (e.g., “How to add a contact”) or conceptual explanations (e.g., “Why use contact subtypes?”) are needed, those should be split into separate Guide or Explanation pages.
