# Overview of organizing your data in CiviCRM

## Why planning your data matters

CiviCRM helps your organisation manage information about your contacts, donations, events, and more. To get the most out of CiviCRM, it’s important to think carefully about how your data is currently stored and how it should be structured in CiviCRM.

Before you start using CiviCRM, review how you currently keep track of information. Data might be stored in spreadsheets, another CRM system, paper files, or even just in people’s memories. Talk with staff and volunteers—especially those who have been with your organisation the longest and those who are new—to get a full picture of your contacts and how you interact with them.

## Understanding your contacts and data

Many organisations overlook the variety of people they interact with. Take time to identify everyone involved with your organisation. Consider the different types of contacts (like donors, members, volunteers, alumni, parents, or major donors) and how you interact with each group. The better you understand these relationships, the better you can organise your data in CiviCRM.

Feedback from your contacts, whether gathered informally or systematically, can help you understand their needs and preferences.

## Key questions to ask about your data

- Do you use an existing CRM system?
- Do you have spreadsheets with contact, donation, or other important information?
- Are there notes, files, or other paper records with community details?
- Does anyone in your organisation have special knowledge about your community members?
- How does money come into your organisation?
- What are the daily tasks your staff and volunteers handle?
- How do you currently communicate with donors, members, volunteers, and others? How would you like to communicate with them in the future?
- How do you track activities and communications (emails, meetings, events) with your community?
- Do you keep track of donors’ interests and preferences?
- How do you handle new contacts?
- What labels or categories do you use for your contacts (such as alumni, students, parents, major donor, volunteer)?
- Are there reports you’d like to create? What information should they include?

## Adapting to CiviCRM

CiviCRM is flexible and designed for a wide range of non-profit needs, but it may not match your current processes exactly. You may need to adjust your workflows to fit CiviCRM’s structure and take advantage of best practices in non-profit technology. Be open to change—sometimes, doing things “the CiviCRM way” can help your organisation work more efficiently and connect with your community in new ways.

CiviCRM also offers opportunities for new types of engagement with your contacts, which can lead to improvements in your work.

## Thinking about your data migration

Moving your data into CiviCRM is like moving to a new home. It’s a good time to decide what’s important to keep and what can be left behind. Review your data and ask:

- Is there old information (such as outdated organisational divisions or office locations) that you no longer need?
- Are there old lists (like founding donors) that might still be valuable?

Cleaning up your data before moving it into CiviCRM helps you start with a reliable, useful database. Standardise how information is recorded (for example, use consistent abbreviations for states), and remove duplicates, errors, and outdated records.

The next chapters will help you understand what kinds of data CiviCRM can store and how to map your existing records to its structure.

# comment: Suggestion: This page is best categorized as an Explanation, as it provides background, context, and reasoning for planning and organising data before using CiviCRM. It does not provide step-by-step instructions (Tutorial), specific problem-solving actions (Guide), or exhaustive factual details (Reference). The content is introductory and suitable for users new to CiviCRM, so the level is Basic. The logical section is "Organising your data". If desired, practical step-by-step guides for mapping or migrating data could be split into separate Guide or Tutorial pages.
