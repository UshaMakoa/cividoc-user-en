# Review survey results in a report

## Steps to review and analyse survey results

To see and analyse the responses to your CiviCRM surveys, you can use the Survey Report (Detail) tool. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Administer > CiviReport > Create New Report from Template** in your CiviCRM menu.

2. Under **Campaign Report Templates**, select **Survey Report (Detail)**.  
   Alternatively, you can click on a survey name directly from the survey dashboard.

3. On the **Columns** tab, select the checkboxes for **Survey Responses** and any other information you want to see in the report, such as **Street Number** and **Street Name**.

4. On the **Filters** tab:
   - In the **Survey** dropdown, choose the name of your survey.
   - In **Respondent Status**, select **Interviewed**.

5. You may see another dropdown named after your custom set of survey questions.  
   Use this to filter your report by specific responses (for example, show only “yes” answers to a particular question).

6. Click **Preview Report** to see the results.

7. In the Survey Report (Detail) screen, you can:
   - View the results directly.
   - Export the report as a CSV file for further analysis.

8. If you want a formatted report with a cover sheet of questions and responses, and street names in order, click **Print Preview**.

The content is suitable for Basic level users, as it assumes no prior expertise and uses simple, direct instructions.
