# What you need to know about CiviSurvey

## Key concepts

- **Custom fields and profiles:**  
  To collect survey responses, you use *profiles* in CiviCRM. Profiles display your survey questions to participants. Before you start, decide what questions you want to ask and what type of answers you need (for example, yes/no, multiple choice, or open-ended). For multiple choice questions, set up custom fields with option values. You can create a new profile either from the main profile screen or while creating your survey.

- **Reserving and releasing respondents:**  
  Before collecting responses, you need a *group* of contacts to survey. This can be an existing group or a new one created for the survey. In CiviCRM, this is called *reserving respondents*. After a contact completes the survey and their data is recorded, they are *released* from the group. Surveys are mainly for existing contacts; if you want to survey the general public, use the Petition tool instead.

- **CiviCampaign and CiviEngage:**  
  Surveys are part of the CiviCampaign component, so you need to have CiviCampaign enabled. However, you can create surveys that are not linked to a specific campaignâ€”for example, to gather feedback from members without tying it to a campaign. If you use CiviEngage (on Drupal sites), you get extra options for tracking survey responses.

- **Drupal permissions:**  
  If your organisation uses Drupal, make sure to set permissions so the right roles can reserve and release campaign contacts for surveys.

## Key questions to consider

- Is your survey part of a campaign, or is it a standalone survey?
- What questions do you want to ask, and what type of answers do you need (standardised or open-ended)?
- How many questions will you include? If you have more than three, consider using the Petition tool instead.
- Who will conduct the survey, and how will responses be entered into CiviCRM?
- Which group of contacts do you want to survey?
