# Track voters with GOTV (Voter Tracking)

## What you need before you start

- **CiviCampaign must be enabled** for your CiviCRM installation.
- You should have **created a survey** and a **group of contacts** you plan to interview.
- You need to have **reserved respondents** for your survey (these are the contacts you want to track).

If you need help with surveys or reserving respondents, see the CiviSurvey section.

## Steps to track who has voted

1. **Go to the GOTV (Voter Tracking) screen**  
   In your CiviCRM menu, click on **Campaigns**, then select **GOTV (Voter Tracking)**.

2. **Search for your survey and group**
   - In the search form:
     - For **Survey (required)**, select the survey you are using.
     - For **Group(s)**, choose the group of contacts you want to track.
   - Click **Search**.

3. **Record who has voted**
   - In the results, find the **Voted?** column.
   - Tick the checkbox next to each person who you know has voted at the polls.

4. **View more information about a contact (optional)**
   - Hover your mouse over the contact icon next to a personâ€™s name to see extra details about that individual.

# comment: Suggestion: This is a How-to Guide because it addresses a specific, practical task (tracking voters) without providing background or reference details. The steps are action-oriented and assume the user is already familiar with basic CiviCRM navigation. If more conceptual information about GOTV and its purpose is needed, that should be split into an Explanation page.
