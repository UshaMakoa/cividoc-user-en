## How to report on all text message activity

To see a summary or details of all SMS (text message) activity recorded in CiviCRM, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Activities report**  
   In your CiviCRM dashboard, navigate to:  
   **Reports > Contact Reports**.

2. **Select SMS activity types**  
   In the report filters, look for the activity type options.  
   Choose one or more of the following to focus on SMS messages:
   - Inbound SMS
   - Mass SMS
   - SMS delivery

3. **Filter your results (optional)**  
   You can further narrow down your report by:
   - Message status (for example, completed or scheduled)
   - Date and time
   - Recipient group or tag
   - Recipient details, such as name or location

4. **Preview your report**  
   After setting your filters, click **Preview Report** at the bottom of the Filters window to see the results.

You can use these steps to quickly check how many messages were sent, track delivery status, or review which contacts received texts.

# comment: Suggestion: This is a Guide because it provides a clear, step-by-step set of actions for a specific task (reporting on SMS activity) and does not include background, theory, or exhaustive reference details. The level is Basic, as it is aimed at newer users learning to perform a routine task. If the original page included more details on each report field or SMS activity type, that could be split into a Reference page.
