# What is SMS?

## Understanding SMS in CiviCRM

**SMS** stands for Short Message Service, which is the technical term for the text messages you send and receive on your mobile phone every day. In CiviCRM, SMS allows your organisation to send and receive these text messages directly from within the system, giving you another way to reach and interact with your contacts besides email.

## Why use SMS in your organisation?

SMS can be a valuable communication tool for non-profits, especially in situations where email or internet access is limited or unreliable. Here are some common ways organisations use SMS with CiviCRM:

- **Share important updates** with people in areas where internet access is unavailable or unstable.
- **Collect responses or information** from contacts in remote locations.
- **Run SMS campaigns** to raise awareness or promote events.
- **Send alerts and reminders** about meetings or deadlines.
- **Notify event participants** quickly if there are last-minute changes to the time or location.

SMS is a practical way to make sure your messages are delivered directly to your contactsâ€™ phones, increasing the chances that they will read and respond.
