# History of this book

## How the CiviCRM user guide was created

The CiviCRM User Guide is the result of teamwork and collaboration from many people over several years. Much of the content was written during two "book sprints" in 2009 and 2010, where contributors gathered to quickly create and improve the manual together. Many individuals have also added updates and new sections in the years since.

## Editions and milestones

- **Sixth edition (2025):** Written with help of AI to categorize all the doc's pages with the Diataxis framework CiviCRM.
- **Fifth edition (2012):** Written at the Woolman Sierra Friends Centre in California, with contributions from Woolman staff and others. Woolman uses and supports CiviCRM.
- **Fourth edition (2011):** Produced in Bourne, UK. The team focused on writing and updating content for this edition.
- **Third edition (2010):** Updated to reflect changes in CiviCRM version 3.3 and released for the second annual CiviCon conference. Sponsors helped distribute copies to participants.
- **Second edition:** Created after a four-day book sprint led by Adam Hyde and sponsored by the Open Society Institute. This edition added new sections and reorganized the manual to make it easier for users to find relevant chapters based on their needs.
- **First edition:** Written during a five-day sprint in Lake Tahoe, California, with a diverse group of contributors from around the world. The team aimed to capture a wide range of experiences and perspectives to make the manual useful for all types of organisations.

## Collaborative spirit and international contributions

People from many backgrounds and countries worked together to write and edit the guide. The process included lively discussions about language, terminology, and how best to serve users from different regions. The team valued inclusivity and aimed to make the manual accessible to everyone, regardless of their organisation's size or location.

## Acknowledgements

Many individuals contributed their time, expertise, and hospitality during the book sprints and editing process. The guide also benefited from sponsorships and support from organisations and volunteers who believe in open, collaborative documentation.
