# Everyday tasks for managing grants

## Using the CiviGrant dashboard

To see a summary of all grants in your CiviCRM system and a list of recent grant recipients, go to **Other > Grants > Dashboard**. The dashboard gives you an overview grouped by grant type and shows the latest grants added to your database.

## Viewing grants

You can view grants in two main ways:

- Use the **Grants dashboard** to see a summary of grant statuses and types, as well as recent grants.
- Open an individual contact’s record and select the **Grants** tab to see all grants associated with that person or organisation.

## Adding and editing grant recipients

To record a new grant for a recipient:

1. Go to **Other > Grants > New Grant**.
2. Find and select the contact who will receive the grant, or create a new contact if they are not in your system yet.
3. Fill in the grant details. Include as much information as you can, such as custom fields set up by your organisation. You can update or add more details later if needed.
4. Click **Save**.

If you need to update a grant later, open the grant record and use the **edit** link to make changes.

## Recording reports from grant recipients

When you receive a report from a grant recipient:

- Edit the relevant grant record (either from the dashboard or the contact’s grants tab).
- Tick the **Grant Report Received?** box on the form.
- Add any notes or details about the report as needed.

# comment: This page is a Guide because it gives step-by-step instructions for common, goal-oriented tasks (viewing, adding, editing grants) without background theory or exhaustive reference. The instructions are practical and action-focused, matching the Diátaxis definition of a Guide[3][4]. The level is Basic, as it assumes no advanced knowledge or configuration. The logical section is Grants > Everyday tasks.
