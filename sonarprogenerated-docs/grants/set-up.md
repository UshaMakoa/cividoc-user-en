# CiviGrant set-up

## Enabling CiviGrant

To begin using CiviGrant, you need to enable the extension:

- Go to **Administer > System Settings > Extensions**.
- Find and enable the **CiviGrant** extension.

## Grant types

You can define different types of grants your organisation will use:

- Go to **Administer > CiviGrant > Grant types**.
- Add a title and description for each grant type your organisation needs.

*Note: You cannot add custom data fields directly to grant types, but you can add them to individual grants.*

## Grant statuses

Grant statuses help you track the progress of each grant:

- Go to **Administer > System Settings > Option Groups**.
- Find the **Grant status** line.
- Click **Options** to view, add, or edit the list of statuses to match your workflow.

## Custom data for grants

You can add custom fields to collect extra information about each grant:

- Go to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Custom Fields**.
- Click **Add Set of Custom Fields**.
- Set **Used For** to **Grant**.

Consider adding custom fields for things like uploading the original application form (PDF format is recommended for future compatibility).

For more details on creating custom fields, see the **Creating Custom Fields** section.
