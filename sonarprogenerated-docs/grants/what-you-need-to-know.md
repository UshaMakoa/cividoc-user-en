# What you need to know about CiviGrant

## Key concepts

CiviGrant is a tool in CiviCRM that helps organisations manage the process of giving grants. It is designed to be straightforward, especially if you are already familiar with other parts of CiviCRM.

To use CiviGrant effectively, it helps to understand these key ideas:

### CiviGrant workflow

The typical workflow begins when a contact applies for a grant. You record details such as the amount requested and the application date. As the process continues, you track each stage, including the decision (approved or not), the amount awarded, when funds are transferred, and when grant reports are due or received.

### Grant types

Your organisation can define different types of grants, depending on what you offer. You can create as many types as you need, and you can search for grants by type.

### Grant statuses

CiviGrant comes with three basic statuses: Pending, Granted, and Rejected. You can add more statuses to match how your organisation manages grants.

### Application forms and eligibility criteria

You can build application forms and set up eligibility criteria using CiviCRM’s custom data fields. Consider what information should be linked to the applicant (the contact) and what should be linked to the grant itself.

## Key questions to consider

Before you start working with CiviGrant, it’s helpful to answer these questions for your organisation:

- What types of grants do you offer?
- What steps are in your grant application process, and how can you match these to CiviGrant statuses?
- Do you use an application form, and how could you set this up using custom data fields?
- What kinds of reports do you want to create from your grant data?

# comment: Suggestion: This page provides background, definitions, and context for CiviGrant, helping users understand the main concepts and preparatory questions before using the component. This matches the Diátaxis "Explanation" type. The content is introductory and does not provide step-by-step instructions or exhaustive reference details, so "Basic" is the appropriate level. For non-experts, splitting off step-by-step setup or everyday tasks into separate "Guide" or "Tutorial" pages would improve clarity.
