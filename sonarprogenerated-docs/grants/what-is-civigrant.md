# What is CiviGrant?

## Overview

CiviGrant is a feature in CiviCRM designed for organisations that **distribute funds to others**, such as foundations or community groups. Unlike CiviContribute, which tracks money coming into your organisation, CiviGrant focuses on **money going out**, helping you manage the full grant application and distribution process.

## Key features

- **Tracks grant applications**: Record who applied, how much they requested, and the status of each application.
- **Manages the grant process**: Store eligibility questionnaires, application documents, and decisions.
- **Supports workflows**: Helps you review, score, approve, or reject applications based on your criteria.
- **Monitors reporting and feedback**: Follow up with recipients for required reports and feedback, and keep everything organised in one place.
- **Integrates with CiviMail**: Send reminders and collect reports from grant recipients efficiently.

## Example scenario

Imagine a small community group, like Wookie Hole Community Action, that gives out £40,000 in grants each year to support a local festival. Each applicant fills out an eligibility questionnaire and submits an application. The group reviews applications, scores them, and decides how to allocate the funds. After grants are awarded, they use CiviGrant to send emails requesting feedback and final reports from recipients. Once all feedback is received, they generate thank-you notes and certificates for funders and participants—all managed within CiviCRM.

## When to use CiviGrant

- If your organisation **gives out grants or funds** to other groups or individuals.
- If you need to **track applications, decisions, and reporting** in a structured way.
- If your grant process is more complex, you can use CiviGrant together with CiviCase for advanced workflows.
