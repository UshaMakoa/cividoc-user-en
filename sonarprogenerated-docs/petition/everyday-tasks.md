# Everyday petition tasks

## Manage your petitions

To view, manage, or edit your petitions:

- Go to **Campaigns > Dashboard > Petitions** in your CiviCRM menu.
- Here you will see a list of all your petitions. You can select any petition to view or make changes.

## Send out a petition for signing

Once your petition is ready, you can share it so people can sign:

- Go to **Campaigns > Dashboard > Petitions**.
- Find your petition and click **More > Sign** next to its name.
- The petition form will open. Copy the web address (URL) from your browser.
- Share this link by email with your contacts or add it to your website so people can access and sign your petition.

## Collect responses online

After you share your petition link, people can fill out the form and submit their responses online.

- When someone completes the form and clicks **Sign the Petition**, they will see a message asking them to check their email and verify their email address.
- This helps ensure that only valid signatures are counted.

## Collect signatures

To see who has signed your petition:

- Go to **Campaign > Dashboard > Petitions**.
- Click **More > Signatures** next to your petition.
- You can view the list of people who have signed.
- You can select contacts and perform actions, such as sending an email or updating their information in bulk.

## Review results with activity report

To review and analyze petition results:

- Go to **Reports > Create Reports from Templates > Activity Report**.
- In the **Display Column** area, choose which fields you want to see, such as the signer's email address.
- Expand the **Petition Questions** area and select any specific responses you want to review.
- Click **Preview Report** to see the results.
- You can also export the report to a CSV file for further analysis.
