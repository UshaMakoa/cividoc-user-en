# What is CiviMail?

## Overview

**CiviMail** is a tool within CiviCRM that helps your organisation send emails to many people at once, such as newsletters, event invitations, or campaign updates. It is designed to handle large volumes of email reliably and lets you track how well your messages are performing.

You can use CiviMail to:
- Send targeted emails to specific groups, like people interested in certain events or all your contacts.
- Make sure people who unsubscribe from your messages are not emailed again by mistake.
- Test different versions of messages to see which works better for your audience.
- Get detailed reports on how many people opened your emails, clicked links, or forwarded your messages.

CiviMail works closely with your mail server. Setting up CiviMail and configuring your mail server is usually a job for your system administrator or someone with technical expertise. You may need to check with your web hosting provider about any limits on how many emails you can send per day. If your mail server is not set up correctly, your emails could be marked as spam, which can be difficult to fix.

For more information about setting up your email system, see the Email system configuration section in the Initial set up part of this guide.

## Real-world scenarios

Here are some examples of how organisations use CiviMail:

- **Managing event mailing lists:**  
  St Ethelburga's Centre for Peace and Reconciliation runs events on different themes. They let people sign up to receive emails about specific themes. With CiviMail, they send targeted emails to these groups. If someone unsubscribes, CiviCRM remembers and ensures they are not emailed again about that theme.

- **Mobilising supporters:**  
  The Townsville Organisation For Tenants (TOFT) used CiviMail to recruit volunteers and promote a campaign. They sent targeted emails to volunteers and then a mass email to supporters with links to a petition. CiviMail tracked how many people clicked the links or forwarded the email, helping TOFT measure the campaign’s impact.

CiviMail helps your organisation communicate efficiently, respect your contacts’ preferences, and understand the results of your email campaigns.
