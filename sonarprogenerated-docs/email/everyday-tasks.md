# Everyday email tasks

## Send an email to one person (with CC and BCC)

You can send an email to an individual contact in CiviCRM, which is helpful if you want to keep a record of the message or use a template.

1. **Find the contact you want to email:**
   - Use the Quick Search box at the top left—type part of the person's name or email, then select them from the list.
   - Or go to Search > Find Contact, enter part of the name or email, click Search, and select the person from the results.

2. **Start your email:**
   - On the contact’s summary page, click Actions > Send an email, or go to the Activities tab and choose Send an Email from the dropdown.

3. **Add recipients (optional):**
   - Use the CC and BCC fields to include additional people.

4. **Use a template (optional):**
   - If your organisation has templates, select one from the Use Template menu. You can edit the content after selecting.

5. **Write your message:**
   - Enter your content. If you only want to send plain text, use the Plain Text Format section.

6. **Send your message:**
   - Click Send.

7. **Check the activity record:**
   - To see the email you just sent, open the Activities tab for the contact.

## Send a quick email to less than 50 contacts

You can send a simple email to a small group (up to 50 people) directly from search results. This is quick, but does not track emails or allow recipients to opt out. For larger mailings, use CiviMail.

1. **Find your contacts:**
   - Use Search > Find Contacts or Advanced Search to select who you want to email.

2. **Select contacts and start email:**
   - In the search results, select the contacts, then choose Actions > Email - send now (to 50 or less).

3. **Compose and send:**
   - Follow the same steps as for sending an email to one person.

**Note:** Each recipient will only see their own address in the To field. If you want everyone to know who received the email, mention the group in your message (for example: "TO: Members of the board, staff").

## Insert an image in an email

You can add images to your emails using the built-in editor.

1. **Click the image button** in the WYSIWYG editor.

2. **Choose your image:**
   - In the Image Properties window, click Browse Server.
   - If the image is already uploaded, find and select it. Otherwise, click Upload to choose a file from your computer.

3. **Upload (if needed):**
   - Select your image file and click Open. You can upload several files at once.

4. **Insert the image:**
   - Double-click the image you want. You’ll return to the Image Properties window.

5. **Adjust settings:**
   - Set the size, alignment, and border. Fill in the Alternative Text field so people using screen readers or those who can’t see images still get the information.

6. **Finish:**
   - Click OK to insert the image.

# comment: Suggestion: This page is a Guide, as it provides step-by-step actions for specific, common email-related tasks in CiviCRM. It is aimed at basic users. The content belongs under "Email > Everyday tasks". If needed, the image insertion instructions could be split into a separate short Guide page for clarity, but for non-experts, grouping these everyday email tasks together is likely most helpful.
