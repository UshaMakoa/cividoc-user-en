# Conducting a phone bank

Phone banking lets your organisation reach out to supporters or constituents by phone and record their responses in CiviCRM. Here’s how to set up and run a phone bank:

## 1. Create the campaign and survey for your phone bank

- Make a new group of contacts you want to call (see the Groups and Tags section for help).
- If you haven’t already, create a campaign: go to **Campaigns > New Campaign** and add your group.
- Go to **Campaigns > Create New Survey** and create a new survey of type **PhoneBank**.
- For **Profile**, select the custom profile for this survey.
- For **Survey Responses**, choose **Use existing result set** and **Survey Default Results Set Options**.
- Click **Save**.

## 2. Reserve the target group you want to survey

- Go to **Campaigns > Reserve Respondents**.
- Select your survey and your target group, then click **Search**.
- On the results screen, select the contacts you want to survey and click **Go to Reserve Respondents**.
- On the next screen, click **Reserve**.

## 3. Conduct your phone bank and record responses

- During the phone bank, volunteers or staff can look up the group of contacts and enter responses directly into CiviCRM.
- Go to **Campaigns > Interview Respondents**.
- Enter the survey name and the target group.
- On the results screen, select the contacts and click **Go**.
- Enter the responses and click **Record Response**.

## 4. Review the results

- Program leads can review survey results using the reporting features in CiviCRM (see the Reports and Analysis chapter).
