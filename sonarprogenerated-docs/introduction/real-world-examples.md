# comment: Suggestion: This page is an Explanation, as it provides context and background through stories, not step-by-step instructions or factual reference. It is best suited for users seeking to understand CiviCRM’s real-world impact, not for performing a specific task. The level is Basic, and it belongs in the Introduction section. If desired, individual case studies could be split into short Guides for specific goals (e.g. “How to set up a Parent Portal with CiviCRM”), but the current content is best kept as Explanation.
