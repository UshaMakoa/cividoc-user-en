# Contribution reports overview

## What are contribution reports?

CiviCRM provides a set of built-in **contribution reports** to help your organisation analyse donations and income. These reports allow you to view, group, and compare contributions in different ways to understand your fundraising results.

## Types of contribution reports

- **Contribution summary report**: Groups contributions by contact, time period, type, or location, and shows summary statistics. Click a row for more details about that group.
- **Contribution detail report**: Shows detailed information for a specific set of contributions. You can access this from the summary report or run it directly.
- **Repeat contribution report**: Compares the total amount given by contacts in two different time periods and shows percentage changes. Useful for tracking donors who have increased or decreased their giving.
- **SYBUNT and LYBUNT reports**: Identify donors who gave in "Some Years But Not This Year" (SYBUNT) or "Last Year But Not This Year" (LYBUNT).
- **Contribution by household/organisation reports**: Aggregate contributions by household or organisation. Useful for thanking groups or tracking collective donations.
- **Top donors report**: Lists your top donors for a chosen time period. You can set how many donors to include, or show all matching contacts.
- **Personal campaign page report**: Gives an overview of all personal campaign pages, with filters for specific campaigns.
- **Soft credit report**: Shows all soft credits, so you can see who helped bring in donations.
- **Contribution aggregate by relationship report**: Lists a contactâ€™s donation history, including contributions from their related contacts, grouped by year.
- **Recurring contributions report**: Provides information about the status of ongoing, recurring donations.
- **Bookkeeping transactions report**: Lists all payment transaction details, including financial type, accounts, transaction numbers, invoice IDs, payment instruments, and check numbers.

# comment: Suggestion: The original page is a Reference, as it systematically lists and describes available reports and their purposes, without step-by-step instructions or background explanation. This is suitable for users who want to look up what reports exist and what they do. The level is Basic, as it introduces the available reports and their uses for non-experts.
