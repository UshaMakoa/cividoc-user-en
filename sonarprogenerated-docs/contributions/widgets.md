# Create and use contribution widgets

## What is a contribution widget?

A **contribution widget** is a small, automatically updated box you can add to your website (or other sites) to show the progress of a fundraising campaign and encourage donations. It helps your supporters see your campaign’s impact and makes it easy for them to donate.

## How to create a widget

1. Go to your CiviCRM dashboard.
2. Click on **Contributions** and choose **Manage Contribution Pages**.
3. Find the campaign (Contribution Page) you want to use and click **Configure**.
4. At the top, select the **Widgets** tab.
5. Click **Enable Widget** to start setting up your widget.
6. Fill in these details:
   - **Title**: Give your widget a clear name. This can match your campaign, but it does not have to.
   - **Logo Image URL**: If you want to show a logo, enter the web address of an image. (You might need help from your website manager to get this.)
   - **Button Title**: This is the text on the button people click to donate (for example, “Contribute”).
   - **About text**: Add a short message about your campaign. Keep it brief if the widget will be small.
7. When you’re ready, click **Save and Preview** to see how your widget will look.

## How to add the widget to your website

- On the right side of the widget setup page, you’ll see a box with code.
- Click **Select Code** to highlight all the code.
- Copy the code.
- Paste it into your website where you want the widget to appear. (You may need help from your website administrator.)

## Customizing your widget’s colors

- At the bottom of the widget setup page, find and expand **Edit Widget Colors**.
- You can set colors for different parts of the widget. You’ll need the “hex codes” for your chosen colors (for example, `#003366`). An online color picker can help you find these codes.
- If your organisation has standard colors, ask your designer or web manager for the correct codes.
- Click **Save and Preview** to see your changes.

## Using widgets with WordPress

If your website uses WordPress, you can use the **CiviCRM Contribution Page Widget** plugin. This lets you easily place your widget anywhere that accepts WordPress widgets.

# comment: Suggestion: The original page is a step-by-step, goal-oriented guide for non-experts on how to create, customize, and use widgets, which fits the Diátaxis "Guide" category. It is not a tutorial (no first-time learning flow), not a reference (not exhaustive config/options listing), and not an explanation (no background or "why").
