# Managing premiums (thank-you gifts)

## Add or edit a premium

You can offer thank-you gifts—called **premiums**—to supporters who make contributions. Here’s how to set them up:

1. Go to **Administer > CiviContribute > Premiums (Thank-You Gifts)** in your CiviCRM menu.
2. To add a new premium, click **Add Premium**.  
   To change an existing premium, click **Edit** next to the item you want to update.
3. Fill in the details for your premium:
   - **Name**: The name of the gift (for example, "CiviCRM T-shirt").
   - **Description**: A short description of the item.
   - **SKU**: An optional product code for your internal tracking.
   - **Premium image**: (Optional) Upload a picture of the item.
   - **Minimum contribution amount**: The smallest donation amount needed to receive this gift.
   - **Market value**: The typical retail value of the item.
   - **Actual cost**: (Optional) What your organisation pays for the item.
   - **Financial type**: (Optional) For accounting or tracking purposes.
   - **Options**: If your gift comes in different colours or sizes, add those choices here.

## Set up subscriptions or services as premiums

If your premium is a subscription or a service (like a magazine subscription or a membership), you can set additional options:

1. In the premium settings, look for **Subscription or Service Settings**.
2. Enter the details:
   - **Period type**: Choose if the subscription is for a fixed period (like a calendar year) or rolling (starts when the donor gives).
   - **Fixed period start day**: If you chose fixed, set the start date.
   - **Duration**: How long the subscription or service lasts (for example, 12 months).
   - **Frequency**: How often the subscription or service is delivered (for example, monthly).

# comment: Suggestion: This page is a How-to Guide because it provides action steps for a specific task (setting up and managing premiums/thank-you gifts) and does not cover background, theory, or exhaustive options. The content is basic, as it is suitable for new users learning how to add and configure premiums for donor contributions. If the page included a detailed list of all premium fields and their technical meanings, that would be Reference material. If it explained why or when to use premiums, that would be Explanation.
