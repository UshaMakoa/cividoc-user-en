# Understanding soft credits in CiviCRM

## What are soft credits?

Soft credits let you give recognition to people or organisations who helped bring in a donation, even if they are not the actual donor. For example, if someone encourages a friend to donate, you can record both the donor and the person who inspired the gift. This helps your organisation better understand and acknowledge everyone involved in your fundraising efforts.

## Why use soft credits?

Soft credits are important for:

- **Recognising fundraisers and influencers**: They let you thank and track people who help raise money, not just those who give directly.
- **Accurate reporting**: You can see the true impact of supporters who bring in donations, without counting the same contribution twice.
- **Supporting different fundraising types**: Soft credits work for donations from donor-advised funds, gifts in memory or honour of someone, and peer-to-peer fundraising.

## Types of soft credits in CiviCRM

CiviCRM comes with several built-in soft credit types, including:

- **In Honor of**
- **In Memory of**
- **Solicited**
- **Personal Campaign Page**
- **Gift**

You can also create custom types to fit your organisation’s needs.

## How soft credits work: examples

- If a member encourages 10 friends to donate, you can record those donations as soft credits for the member, so you know who helped bring in the gifts.
- For more complex cases, like a community foundation donating after being asked by one of your supporters, you can assign the donation to the foundation (the donor), give a “Solicited” soft credit to the supporter, and a “Donor Advised” soft credit to the person who recommended the gift.

## Reporting on soft credits

CiviCRM’s reports can show soft credit details, so you can easily see and share who helped raise funds for your organisation.

## Soft credits and honoree information

When you set up a contribution page, you can let donors give in honour of someone. CiviCRM will check if the honoree already exists in your database and add a soft credit for them, or create a new contact if needed.

## Soft credits and personal campaign pages

If someone donates through a personal campaign page, the donation is automatically soft credited to the campaign page owner, helping you track peer-to-peer fundraising.
