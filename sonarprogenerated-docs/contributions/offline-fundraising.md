# Offline fundraising

## Overview

Your organisation may collect donations in person at events, by mail, or through other offline methods. To keep your records accurate and up to date, you need to enter these offline donations into CiviCRM manually. This guide will help you:

- Create lists of people to contact for offline fundraising
- Prepare and send postal mailings
- Enter offline contributions into CiviCRM

## Step 1: Create your recipient list

1. Go to **Search > Find Contacts** in CiviCRM to find the people you want to include in your offline fundraising campaign. This might be everyone in your database or a specific group.
2. To keep track of who receives your mailing or to measure its success, save your search results as a group:
   - Select the contacts using the checkboxes.
   - From the **Actions** dropdown, choose **Group - add contacts** or **Group - create smart group**.
   - You can later use this group to record who received your appeal (for example, by adding an activity for each recipient).

## Step 2: Prepare your postal mailings

You can send letters using CiviCRM’s built-in PDF letter feature or by exporting your contact list for use with a word processor.

**To export your contact list:**

1. Select the contacts you want to include.
2. From the **Actions** dropdown, choose **Export Contacts**.
3. Choose to export either **PRIMARY fields** (for a quick export) or **Select fields for Export** (to choose specific details).
4. If you select specific fields, pick the ones you need and optionally save your selection for future use.
5. Click **Export** to download a CSV file.
6. Click **Done** to return to your contact list.

You can now use this CSV file with your word processor’s mail merge feature to create personalised letters.

## Step 3: Print mailing labels (optional)

CiviCRM can create mailing labels for your recipients.

1. Use the same search as above to find your recipients.
2. From the **Actions** dropdown, select **Mailing labels - print**.
3. Choose the label format, whether to exclude people who have opted out of mail (recommended), and whether to merge labels for people at the same address (useful for households or organisations).
4. Click **Make Mailing Labels** to generate a printable PDF.

*Note: Labels are printed in the order shown on the search results page, moving down each column before starting the next.*

## Next steps

After sending your mailings, you will need to manually enter any donations you receive into CiviCRM. See the “Manual entry of contributions” guide for instructions.
