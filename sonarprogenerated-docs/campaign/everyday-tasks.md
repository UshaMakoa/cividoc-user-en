# Everyday campaign tasks

## Managing campaigns

You can manage your organisation’s campaigns using the **Campaign Dashboard**. This dashboard lets you create, edit, disable, or delete campaigns, as well as view all existing campaigns.

To open the dashboard:
- Go to **Campaigns > Dashboard > Campaigns**.

If you have many campaigns, use the search filters to show only the ones you need.

## Creating a new campaign

To start a new campaign:
1. Go to **Campaign > New Campaign**.
2. Fill in the campaign details:
   - **Title** (required): Give your campaign a unique, descriptive name. Using a consistent naming style helps you find campaigns easily.
   - **Campaign type** (required): Choose the type, such as “Constituent Engagement”. (You can add more types in the setup section.)
   - **Description**: Briefly describe your campaign.
   - **Include group(s)**: Select one or more groups you want to target. (See the “Groups and tags” section for help creating groups.)
   - **Start date & time** (required): When your campaign begins.
   - **End date & time**: When your campaign ends. Leave blank if it’s ongoing.
   - **Campaign status**: Choose the current status, like “In Progress” or “Planned”. (More statuses can be added in setup.)
   - **Campaign goals**: Describe what you want to achieve and the activities you plan.
   - **Revenue goals**: If you’re fundraising, enter your target amount.
   - **External ID**: If you’re tracking this campaign from another system, enter its ID here.
   - **Is active?**: Tick if the campaign is currently running.
3. Click **Save**.

## Targeting constituents: create a group

To focus your campaign on specific people, create a group for them. For instructions on creating groups, see the “Groups and tags” section.

## Sending a mass mailing

To reach your audience:
- Create your email using **CiviMail** (see the “Email” section for detailed steps).
- When setting up the mailing, select the campaign from the drop-down list so responses are tracked.

## Running a campaign event

You can link events to your campaign:
- Create and set up your event (see the “Events” section).
- When sending emails about the event, choose the campaign from the drop-down list.
- Use a group or groups to target your audience, and encourage them to register.
- Track who registers and attends.

## Recording campaign contributions

When you receive donations (online or offline), you can link them to your campaign:
- Select the campaign from the drop-down menu when entering the contribution.
- For more on contributions, see the “Contributions” section.

## Recording event participation

To track who took part in your event:
- Collect sign-in sheets at the event and enter the details later, or
- Enter participants directly into CiviCRM during the event if you have internet access.
- For more details, see the “Events” section.

# comment: Suggestion: This page is a "Guide" because it provides step-by-step, action-oriented instructions for common campaign management tasks, without background theory or exhaustive reference detail. The level is "Basic" as it assumes users are new to these processes. If needed, more detailed reference or tutorial content (e.g., a full step-by-step "Create your first campaign" walk-through) could be split off for clarity.
