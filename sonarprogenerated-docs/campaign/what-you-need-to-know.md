# What you need to know

## Key concepts

Your organisation probably already has its own ways of planning and running campaigns. **CiviCampaign** is a tool that can work alongside your current processes to help you organise, track, and automate parts of your campaigns.

## Campaign goals and revenue

Start by clearly defining the **goals** of your campaign and, if relevant, the amount of money you hope to raise. Record these details in CiviCRM when you set up your campaign. This will make it easier to use reports later to see how successful your campaign was.

## Planning your campaign activities

As you plan your campaign, think about which activities (like events, mailings, or surveys) you want to track in CiviCRM. Make sure all relevant activities and information are linked to your campaign in the system. This helps you see the full picture of your efforts and measure how well your strategies are working.

## Key questions to consider

When preparing for a campaign, ask yourself and your team:

- **Who is your target audience, and how will you reach them?**  
  Your campaign activities might target different groups than your main campaign audience. Understanding this helps you choose the right communication strategies.

- **What activities and strategies will you use?**  
  For example, will you hold events or send mailings as part of the campaign?

- **How will you collect data during the campaign, and who will enter it into CiviCRM?**  
  This could include surveys, petitions, or event registrations.

- **What reports will help you monitor progress and evaluate the campaign afterwards?**

## CiviEngage and CiviCampaign

**CiviEngage** is an add-on for Drupal websites that gives CiviCampaign extra features, especially for surveys. It also sets up custom data, profiles, and enhanced reports. If you use CiviEngage, see the Civic Engagement section for more details.
