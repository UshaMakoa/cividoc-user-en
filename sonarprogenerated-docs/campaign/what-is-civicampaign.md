# What is CiviCampaign?

## Overview

**CiviCampaign** is a tool in CiviCRM that lets your organisation bring together different activities—such as events, emails, donations, surveys, and petitions—under one shared campaign or program. This makes it easier to see how all your efforts are working together to achieve a specific goal, like increasing community engagement or fundraising for a project.

## Key features

- **Connect activities:** Link events, mailings, donations, surveys, and petitions to a single campaign so you can see how they contribute to your overall goal.
- **Track engagement:** Record who participates, donates, or responds to surveys and petitions, and monitor their level of interest or involvement.
- **Measure progress:** Review all campaign-related activities and contributions to understand what’s working and where you might want to adjust your approach.
- **Integrated with CiviCRM:** You can select which activities belong to each campaign, making it easy to organise and report on your work.

## Example scenario

Imagine your organisation is running a year-long campaign to mobilise community members. You might:
- Create a campaign in CiviCRM to act as the “umbrella” for all related activities.
- Set a revenue goal and campaign duration.
- Build a group of contacts you want to target.
- Record calls to active members, noting their response and linking it to the campaign.
- Send fundraising emails and track donations as part of the campaign.
- Organise events and track who attends, all under the same campaign.

Throughout the campaign, you can search for and review all related activities and participants, helping you measure your outreach and fundraising efforts. At the end, you can look back at everything connected to the campaign to see what you achieved.

## Additional integrations

If your organisation uses Drupal, the CiviEngage module adds custom fields to support surveys and petitions within CiviCampaign. You can learn more about CiviEngage in the Civic Engagement section.
