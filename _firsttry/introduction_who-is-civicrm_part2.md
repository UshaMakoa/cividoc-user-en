# Joining the CiviCRM community

## Where to start conversations

If you’re new to CiviCRM or have an idea, the best place to begin is the community chat on Mattermost. Here you can ask questions, share ideas, or just get to know other users and developers.

## Finding help and resources

Besides chat, the community offers blogs, forums, and scheduled meetings where you can learn more and get support. You don’t need to be an expert — everyone’s input is welcome.

## Being respectful and positive

Treating others kindly and communicating clearly helps build a friendly space where everyone can learn and grow. The community thrives on respect and collaboration.

## Taking part in events and projects

From online meetings to local meetups, there are many ways to connect with others. If you want to contribute, you can help with documentation, testing, or sharing your experiences.

## Summary

Getting involved with the CiviCRM community is easy and rewarding. Start by joining conversations, asking questions, and sharing your ideas in a respectful and positive way.
