# Is CiviCRM for you?

## Understanding if CiviCRM fits your organisation

CiviCRM is a powerful tool designed to help non-profits manage contacts, fundraising, events, memberships, and more. However, it might not be the perfect fit for every organisation. This guide will help you explore whether CiviCRM meets your needs and how to learn more before getting started.

## How to decide if CiviCRM is right for you

- **Identify your organisation’s needs**: Think about what you want to achieve with your software. Do you need to manage contacts, track donations, organise events, or communicate with supporters? Knowing your goals helps you see if CiviCRM can support them.

- **Explore real examples**: Look at case studies or stories from organisations like yours that use CiviCRM. This can give you a clear idea of how the software works in practice.

- **Try CiviCRM yourself**: Use free demonstration sites to get hands-on experience. You can also try CiviCRM Spark, a hosted service that lets you set up your own CiviCRM quickly and easily, starting at $15 a month. It’s great for testing or for smaller organisations with up to 10,000 contacts.

- **Download and install a test version**: If you have technical support, you can install CiviCRM on your own server or hosting to explore all features without limits.

## Talking to others who use CiviCRM

One of the best ways to learn is by speaking with people who already use CiviCRM. If you know other organisations using it, ask about their experience. The more similar their work is to yours, the more helpful their advice will be.

If you don’t know anyone personally, you can:

- Visit the [CiviCRM Stack Exchange](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com) — a community Q&A site where you can ask questions and find answers from experienced users. When asking questions, try to use CiviCRM terms clearly and keep your question focused to get the best help.

- Join local non-profit technology mailing lists or forums to connect with others using CiviCRM.

Remember, Stack Exchange is volunteer-run, so clear and polite questions help you get faster and better answers.

## Talking to CiviCRM consultants

If you want personalised advice, consider talking to a professional consultant. The CiviCRM website lists contributors, partners, and sponsors who can guide you through how CiviCRM might work for your organisation.

You might also find local web developers or agencies experienced with CiviCRM who can offer support or training.
