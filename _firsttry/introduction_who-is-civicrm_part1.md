# Who is CiviCRM?

## What is the CiviCRM community?

CiviCRM is more than just software — it’s a vibrant, diverse community made up of people who develop, use, and support the system. This includes the core team who build the software, non-profit staff who use it every day, consultants, developers, volunteers, and many others. Everyone brings their own skills and experiences, which helps CiviCRM grow and improve in many unexpected ways.

Being part of this community means sharing ideas, helping each other, and treating everyone with respect. When you join in with kindness and a positive attitude, you’ll find the community welcoming and rewarding.

## A brief history of CiviCRM

CiviCRM began in 2004, created by a small group with experience in non-profits and technology. Early on, they chose to build CiviCRM on Drupal, a popular content management system, which allowed them to focus on features that non-profits really need.

The first release in 2005 included two main modules: CiviMail for email communications and CiviContribute for managing donations. Since then, CiviCRM has grown to include many more features and is now used by thousands of organizations worldwide. It works with several website platforms like Drupal, Joomla!, WordPress, and Backdrop.

Many well-known non-profits such as Amnesty International and the Wikimedia Foundation use CiviCRM, showing its strength and reliability.

## How to connect and contribute

CiviCRM encourages open conversation and collaboration. If you have an idea or question, the best way to start is by talking with others. The community uses Mattermost, a chat platform where you can join discussions, ask for advice, and share your thoughts.

People in the community are friendly and ready to help. Depending on your idea, you might be guided to blog posts, development tools, online meetings, or even in-person meetups.

## Becoming an active community member

If you want to make a difference, it’s important to take charge of your ideas and projects. The community supports you, but you’ll need to find the time and resources to make your plans happen. Balancing your goals with the community’s needs is the best way to succeed.

Even if you work with a consultant, your direct involvement in the community is valuable. Sharing your experiences and questions with others helps everyone improve CiviCRM.

## Summary

CiviCRM is powered by a welcoming and diverse community that values collaboration and respect. Whether you’re just using the software or want to help shape its future, there are many ways to get involved and benefit from being part of this open, supportive network.
