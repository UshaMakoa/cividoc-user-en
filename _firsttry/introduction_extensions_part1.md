# Extensions

## what are extensions?

Extensions are add-ons that give your CiviCRM new features or change how it works. They help you customize your system without affecting everyone else using CiviCRM. Many extensions are created by people in the CiviCRM community and shared for free.

## the extensions directory

The extensions directory is an online library where you can find many useful extensions. It shows popular extensions first, based on how many sites use them. Extensions come in two types:

- **Native extensions:** Work with any website system.
- **CMS-specific extensions:** Made for particular website platforms like Drupal or WordPress. These may be called Drupal Modules or WordPress Plugins.

You can browse the directory at civicrm.org/extensions to see what’s available.

## installing extensions in your CiviCRM

If your CiviCRM is set up correctly, you can install extensions directly from your system:

1. Go to **Administer > System Settings > Extensions**.
2. You’ll see a list of extensions compatible with your CiviCRM version.
3. Choose the extension you want and install it.

If you don’t see any extensions listed, your system might need extra setup. Ask your system administrator for help.

## creating your own extensions

If you have special needs, you can ask a developer to create an extension just for you. Writing extensions requires programming skills, so it’s not something most users do themselves.

If your extension could help other organizations, consider sharing it with the community. Publishing your extension means you can get feedback, bug fixes, and improvements from others.

**Tip:** Start by exploring existing extensions before thinking about creating your own. Many needs are already met by the community’s work.
