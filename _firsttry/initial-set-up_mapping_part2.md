## Getting your API key for Google Maps

To use Google Maps and geocoding, you need an API key from Google Cloud Platform:

- Sign in to your Google Cloud account or create one.
- Create a new project.
- Enable the Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API.
- Generate an API key.
- Restrict the key to your website or server for security.
- Copy the key and paste it into CiviCRM’s Mapping and Geocoding settings.

## Using OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is free and open source and does not require an API key. It’s a great choice if you want to avoid usage limits or costs.
