# What is CiviCRM?

## Introduction

CiviCRM is a free, web-based system designed especially for nonprofits and NGOs to help manage their relationships with people and organizations they work with. It’s more than just an address book — it helps you keep track of donations, events, memberships, communications, and much more, all in one place.

## Why use CiviCRM?

Imagine having a smart assistant that remembers every phone call, meeting, or email you have with someone, and helps you plan your next steps. CiviCRM does this for your organization. It helps you:

- Keep detailed records of your contacts and their information  
- Track interactions like calls, emails, and meetings  
- Manage events, memberships, donations, and campaigns  
- Send targeted emails and invitations  
- Understand your community better to improve your outreach  

## Who is CiviCRM for?

CiviCRM is built by and for nonprofits, NGOs, and civic groups. It works well for organizations of all sizes that want to improve how they connect with supporters, volunteers, donors, and members. Because it’s free and open source, there are no license fees, and you can customize it to fit your needs.

## How does CiviCRM work?

CiviCRM works alongside popular website tools called content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Backdrop. This means your website visitors can:

- Sign up for events or memberships  
- Make donations online  
- Update their contact information  
- Receive newsletters and updates  

All this information flows directly into your CiviCRM system, helping you keep everything organized and up to date.

## What can you do with CiviCRM?

At its simplest, CiviCRM lets you:

- Store contact details like names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers  
- Define relationships between contacts (for example, family members or colleagues)  
- Send emails and keep a record of interactions  
- Track activities and communications  

With additional features called components and extensions, you can also:

- Manage memberships and subscriptions  
- Organize events and registrations  
- Process donations and grants  
- Run campaigns and surveys  

## Summary

CiviCRM is your organization’s digital assistant for managing relationships and activities. It helps you save time, communicate better, and grow your impact — all without extra software costs.
