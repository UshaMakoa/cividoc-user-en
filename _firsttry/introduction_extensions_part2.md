# managing extensions safely

## checking compatibility

Always check that an extension works with your version of CiviCRM before installing. Installing incompatible extensions can cause problems.

## backing up your system

Before installing new extensions, back up your CiviCRM and your website. This way, you can restore your system if something goes wrong.

## updating extensions

Keep your extensions up to date to benefit from new features and security fixes. You can update extensions from the same Extensions page in your CiviCRM.

## removing extensions

If you no longer need an extension, you can uninstall it from the Extensions page. Removing unused extensions helps keep your system clean and secure.
