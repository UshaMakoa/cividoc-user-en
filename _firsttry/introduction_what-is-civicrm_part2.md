# Website integration with CiviCRM

## What is website integration?

CiviCRM works best when connected to a content management system (CMS), which is the software that runs your website. Popular CMS platforms include WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Backdrop. Integrating CiviCRM with your website allows your supporters and members to interact directly with your CRM through your site.

## Benefits of integration

When CiviCRM is integrated with your website, your visitors can:

- Register for events online  
- Join or renew memberships  
- Make donations securely  
- Update their contact information  
- Subscribe to newsletters and email lists  

This creates a smooth experience for your users and keeps your data accurate and up to date without extra manual work.

## How does it work?

The integration connects your website and CiviCRM so they share information. When someone fills out a form on your website, the data is automatically saved in CiviCRM. You can also display information from CiviCRM on your website, like upcoming events or news.

## Getting started

To set up integration, you’ll need:

- A website running one of the supported CMS platforms  
- CiviCRM installed and connected to your CMS  
- Basic knowledge of your CMS’s administration tools  

Once set up, you can create forms, pages, and other features that connect your website visitors with your CRM data.

## Summary

Integrating CiviCRM with your website makes it easier for your community to engage with your organization online while keeping your records accurate and up to date.
