# Real world examples

This page shows how different non-profits use CiviCRM to solve common challenges and improve their work. These stories will help you understand what CiviCRM can do and inspire you as you learn to use it.

## Suffering relieved!

The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a large peace and social justice organization with many offices worldwide. They needed a better way to manage their contacts, send newsletters, and handle event registrations.

### What they did

AFSC set up multiple CiviCRM sites with CiviMail for email communications and used CiviEvent and CiviMember to track events and members. When they found missing features, they worked with the CiviCRM team to add them, benefiting everyone.

### The results

After switching to CiviCRM and resolving hosting issues, AFSC staff could manage contacts, send newsletters, and run events smoothly. Their offices now rely on CiviCRM as their main database, making their work easier and more effective.

## A CRM education

Schoolhouse Supplies (SHS) is a non-profit that collects and distributes school supplies. Before CiviCRM, they used many different software tools and spreadsheets.

### What they did

SHS moved all their data and processes into CiviCRM Standalone, replacing multiple systems with one. They integrated their online store and donation tracking, making operations simpler and more coordinated.

### The results

SHS now uses CiviCRM to manage volunteers, donations, and communications all in one place. This has helped them plan new campaigns and grow their impact.

## Growing satisfaction

The New York State Nursery Landscape Association (NYSNLA) supports nursery and landscape professionals. They wanted to consolidate their member data and offer a public directory online.

### What they did

With help from a consultant, NYSNLA mapped their data into CiviCRM using CiviMember, CiviEvent, CiviContribute, and CiviMail. They tracked certifications and created a searchable member directory on their website.

### The results

Their members can update their own information, and the public can find professionals easily. This improved communication and helped promote the value of certified professionals.

## Campaigning for efficiency

The Green Party of New Zealand manages members, donations, and campaigns across many branches. They needed a system that supported complex access controls and online fundraising.

### What they did

They adopted CiviCRM with Drupal, customized it for their needs, and linked addresses to the Electoral Roll. They created smart groups for targeted communications.

### The results

The party increased online donations and streamlined membership renewals. They continue to explore new features to improve their workflows.

## Quest for success

QuestBridge helps low-income students apply to top colleges using an online application system built on CiviCRM.

### What they did

They developed their application process within CiviCRM, storing student data and communications in one place.

### The results

QuestBridge helped over 1,200 students gain college acceptance efficiently. They plan to upgrade CiviCRM and recommend investing in training early on.

## Changing with the times

The San Francisco School uses CiviCRM to improve communication with families and manage after-school programs.

### What they did

They built a Parent Portal where parents can update contact info, schedule conferences, and register for classes online.

### The results

Parents and staff work better together with up-to-date information and easy access to scheduling and fees. The gradual rollout helped everyone adjust smoothly.
