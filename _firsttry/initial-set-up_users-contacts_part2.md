# Synchronize users to contacts

## What is synchronize users to contacts?

This feature helps you link your website’s user accounts to CiviCRM contact records. It is especially useful when you already have users on your site before installing CiviCRM.

## When should I use it?

- When you add CiviCRM to an existing Drupal or Joomla site.
- To make sure every user has a corresponding contact record.
- To avoid creating duplicate contacts for users.

## How does it work?

The tool checks each user account in your CMS. If a matching contact record doesn’t exist, it creates one automatically.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Log in to CiviCRM with administrator permissions.
2. Navigate to **Administer** > **Users and Permissions** > **Synchronize Users to Contacts**.
3. Click the **Synchronize Users-to-Contacts** button.
4. Confirm by clicking **OK**.
5. Wait for the process to complete and review the summary message.

## After synchronization

- Search your contacts using **Advanced Search**.
- Use the **Change Log** filter to find contacts created during synchronization.
- Edit or update contact records as needed.

## Tips

- Run this tool whenever you add new users outside of CiviCRM to keep your data in sync.
- For Joomla sites, remember users must perform a CiviCRM action to link accounts unless you customize registration forms.
