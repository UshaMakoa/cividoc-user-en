# Components

CiviCRM is made up of different components—think of them as tools that help you manage your contacts and activities more effectively. You can choose which components to use depending on your needs, and turn off those you don’t use to keep your workspace simple and clear. Turning off a component hides it from view but does not delete any data, so you can turn it back on anytime.

Each component focuses on a specific area of your work. Here’s a quick overview of the main components you might use:

## CiviContribute

This tool helps you manage donations and fundraising. You can track contributions, create online donation pages for one-time or recurring gifts, and manage pledges—promises to give money in the future. It also helps you send thank-you messages and reminders for pledge payments.

## CiviMail

CiviMail lets you send personalized emails to your supporters, such as newsletters or announcements. It’s designed for sending mass emails while keeping each message personal and engaging.

## CiviMember

Use this component to manage memberships. It supports online sign-ups and renewals, making it easy to keep track of who belongs to your organization and when their membership expires.

## CiviEvent

Planning an event? CiviEvent helps you create event pages, manage registrations (both free and paid), and keep track of attendees—all in one place.

## CiviReport

CiviReport provides ready-made report templates that you can customize to get insights from your data. It helps you understand how your activities are going and share information with your team or board.

## CiviCampaign

If you run campaigns that include events, emails, activities, and fundraising, CiviCampaign helps you link all these parts together. This way, you can see how everything contributes to your overall goals.

## CiviCase

For organizations that manage individual cases—like social services or legal aid—CiviCase offers tools to track cases, timelines, and outcomes, helping you stay organized and accountable.

## CiviGrant

If your organization gives out grants or funds to others, CiviGrant helps you manage applications, approvals, and reporting related to those grants.
