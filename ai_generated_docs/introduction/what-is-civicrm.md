# What is CiviCRM?  

## Understanding CiviCRM  

CiviCRM is a free, web-based tool designed especially for nonprofit organizations and NGOs to help them manage their relationships with people and groups they work with. It’s more than just an address book — it helps you keep track of contacts, donations, events, memberships, communications, and many other activities all in one place.  

## Why use CiviCRM?  

Imagine having an assistant that remembers every phone call, meeting, or email you have with someone, and helps you follow up at the right time. CiviCRM does this for your organization. It helps you organize your work, communicate better with supporters, and keep everything you need in one system.  

## What can CiviCRM do?  

At its simplest, CiviCRM lets you:  
- Store contact details like names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers  
- Define relationships between people and organizations  
- Send emails and keep a record of your interactions  

With additional features called components and extensions, you can also:  
- Manage memberships and event registrations  
- Track donations and grants  
- Run campaigns and send newsletters  

## How does CiviCRM work with your website?  

CiviCRM works alongside popular website tools called content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Backdrop. This means your website visitors can do things like renew memberships, sign up for events, or donate online, while the information automatically updates in CiviCRM.  

## Why choose CiviCRM?  

CiviCRM is open source software, which means it’s free to use and you have the freedom to customize it to fit your needs. It supports multiple languages and can be accessed online by many users at once, making it a flexible and powerful tool for nonprofits around the world.  

## Summary  

CiviCRM helps nonprofits build stronger relationships, manage their work efficiently, and engage their communities — all through one easy-to-use system designed just for their needs.
