# Who is CiviCRM?

## Understanding the CiviCRM community

CiviCRM is more than just software — it’s a vibrant and diverse community made up of people who develop, use, and support the system. This includes the core team who build the software, non-profit staff who use it every day, consultants, developers, volunteers, and many others. Everyone brings their own skills and experiences, making the community strong and always evolving.

Being part of this community means sharing ideas, helping others, and working together to improve CiviCRM. If you approach the community with kindness and respect, you’ll find it a welcoming and rewarding place.

## A brief history of CiviCRM

CiviCRM began in 2004, created by a small group with deep experience in non-profits and open source software. They chose to build CiviCRM on Drupal, which allowed them to focus on creating useful features for non-profits.

Since its first release in 2005, CiviCRM has grown into the leading open source CRM for non-profits worldwide. It now supports many organizations through a wide range of tools and integrates with popular website platforms like WordPress and Joomla. High-profile non-profits such as Amnesty International and Wikimedia Foundation use CiviCRM to manage their work.

## How to connect and communicate

CiviCRM is an open and friendly community that encourages sharing ideas and learning from each other. If you have an idea or question, the best way to start is by talking with others in the community through chat channels or forums.

You’ll find many experienced people ready to listen, offer advice, and collaborate. Sometimes, discussions lead to blog posts, meetings, or even real-life meetups where you can connect with others face to face.

## Getting involved and making a difference

If you want to contribute to CiviCRM, it helps to have a clear plan for your project or idea. The community supports new contributors, but you will be the one driving your work forward.

Think about how your goals align with your day-to-day work and how you can balance your time. By contributing, you not only help improve CiviCRM but also build valuable skills and connections.

## Your role as a user in the community

Even if you work with a consultant or service provider, you can still be an active member of the CiviCRM community. Sharing your experiences and asking questions openly benefits everyone and helps shape the future of the software.

The community thrives when users, developers, and consultants work together, so your voice matters.
