# Is CiviCRM for you?

## Understanding if CiviCRM fits your organisation

CiviCRM is a powerful tool designed to help non-profit organisations manage their contacts, fundraising, events, and more. However, it may not be the right fit for every organisation. This guide will help you explore whether CiviCRM meets your needs and how you can learn more before making a decision.

## Identify your organisation’s needs

Start by thinking about what your organisation needs from a software system. What tasks do you want to manage better? For example, do you want to keep track of donors, manage events, or send newsletters? Knowing your goals will help you see if CiviCRM offers the features you need.

## Learn from others’ experiences

One of the best ways to understand CiviCRM is to hear how other organisations like yours use it. Look for stories or case studies about groups similar to yours. This can give you real examples of how CiviCRM works in practice and what benefits it can bring.

## Try CiviCRM yourself

You can explore CiviCRM hands-on by using free demonstration sites. Many of these let you play with the software without installing anything. This is a great way to get a feel for how it works and whether it feels like a good fit.

If you want to try a full installation quickly, consider CiviCRM Spark. It is a hosted service that lets you set up your own CiviCRM system in minutes, with plans starting at $15 a month. It’s perfect for testing or for smaller organisations with up to 10,000 contacts.

You can also download and install a test version of CiviCRM on your own computer or server for free if you prefer.

## Talk to others who use CiviCRM

If you know other organisations using CiviCRM, reach out to them and ask about their experience. The more similar their work is to yours, the more helpful their advice will be.

If you don’t know anyone personally, you can join online communities and forums where CiviCRM users share tips and answer questions. When asking for help, try to be clear and use CiviCRM terms to get the best answers quickly.

## Speak with a CiviCRM consultant

If you want personalised advice, consider talking to a professional consultant. Many experts and companies specialise in helping non-profits use CiviCRM effectively. A consultant can guide you through how CiviCRM might work for your organisation and help with setup or training.

## Next steps

Once you’ve explored these options, you’ll be better prepared to decide if CiviCRM is right for your organisation. If you want to learn more about how to use CiviCRM, check out guides with real-world examples and step-by-step tutorials.
