# Everyday tasks with reports in CiviCRM

## Viewing reports

To see a report in CiviCRM:

- Go to the **Reports** menu.
- Choose the type of report you want.
- Find the report you need.
- Click **View Results** to see the report with preset filters.
- Or click the report name to change the filters before viewing.

Some reports show data as tables by default, but if available, you can switch to bar or pie charts using a dropdown menu.

You can also create a PDF of the report for printing or sharing.

If you want to work further with the data, export it as a CSV file to open in a spreadsheet program.

If you have permission, you can adjust the report settings when viewing it. For help with this, see the CiviReport setup guide.

## Adding reports to your dashboard

You can place reports on your dashboard, the first page you see after logging in, to quickly access important information.

To add a report to your dashboard:

- Click **Configure Your Dashboard** on your dashboard.
- Select a report from the list.
- Drag it onto your dashboard.

Note that not all reports may be available to add here.

## Adding report results to a group

Sometimes you want to take the contacts shown in a report and add them to a group for easy management or communication.

If this option is available in your report:

- Use the dropdown menu to select the group to add contacts to.
- This helps you organize contacts based on report results.
