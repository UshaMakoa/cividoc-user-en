# Keeping track of events and participants

## Introduction  
After you create an event and share the registration form with your supporters, CiviCRM lets you manage the people who sign up. This guide explains how to find your events and participants, view their details, and update registrations using the CiviEvent tools. It is designed for non-profit users who are new to managing events in CiviCRM.

## Event dashboard  
The **CiviEvent Dashboard** (found under Events > Dashboard) is your main hub for event information. It shows a summary of up to ten upcoming or recent events, including how many people have registered.  

- Click an event name to see the public event page as visitors do.  
- Click the number of participants to see who has signed up.  
- Use the link *Find more event participants* to search for participants by name, event, date, or status.  
- From the dashboard, you can also:  
  - Manage existing events  
  - Create new events  
  - Access RSS feeds or calendar links to share event data with other applications  

## Finding and viewing events  
To see all your events, go to **Events > Manage Events**. This page lists every event you have created. Use the search filters to find events by name, type, or date.  

For each event, you have quick links to:  
- **Configure** the event settings (like location, fees, registration options)  
- View **Participants** lists (registered, attending, or not attending)  
- Access **Event Links** for registering participants or viewing live event pages  

## Finding and managing participants  
You can find participants for any event by going to **Events > Find Participants**.  

- Start typing the event name to select it.  
- Add other search filters if needed (like participant status or date).  
- Click *Search* to see matching participants.  

Once you have your list, you can select participants and perform actions such as:  
- Cancel registrations  
- Delete participants (removes event data but keeps their contact record)  
- Send emails to participants (for updates or reminders)  
- Export participant data to CSV files for spreadsheets or mail merges  
- Add participants to groups or create smart groups (saved searches that update automatically)  
- Print name badges or letters  
- Change participant status (which can trigger automatic emails)  
- Print selected participant rows  
- Update multiple participants at once using a profile you have created  

## Viewing participant fees  
To see individual fees paid by participants:  
- Go to **Search > Custom Searches**  
- Select **Event Aggregate**  
- Set your search criteria and click *Search*  

## Changing registration details for participants  
Sometimes you need to update a participantâ€™s registration, for example:  
- Changing their role (e.g., from attendee to volunteer)  
- Adjusting fee options or refunds  
- Adding sessions or meal choices  

To do this:  
- Find the participant via **Events > Find Participants**  
- Click *View* or *Edit* next to their registration  
- Click *Change Selections*  
- Make the changes; fees and registration status will update accordingly  

Note: Additional payments or refunds must be entered separately through the payment record linked to the registration.

## Creating and printing event badges  
You can design custom name badges for your events:  
- Go to **Administer > CiviEvent > Event Badge Layout > New Badge Layout**  
- Choose label size (e.g., Avery 5395, A6 Portrait)  
- Add images like your logo or sponsor logos  
- Select up to 6 rows of participant or event information (name, role, sessions, etc.)  
- Optionally add barcodes or QR codes  
- Enable the layout to make it available for printing  

To print badges:  
- Go to **Events > Find Participants**  
- Select participants  
- Choose *Print Event Name Badges* from the actions menu and click *Go*  
- Pick the badge layout and click *Make Name Badges*  
- A PDF will be generated for printing
