# Event Reports in CiviCRM
## Introduction to Event Reporting
Event reporting in CiviCRM allows you to analyze and understand participant data and event income. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing event reports.

## Searching Based on Participant Data
CiviCRM distinguishes between contacts and event participants. You can search based on participant data using the Find Participants search feature. This allows you to return participant data, which is useful for analyzing event attendance.

## Event and Participant Reports
CiviCRM comes with several built-in reports for analyzing events, such as the Event Participants List and Event Income Summary. These reports can be used to display participant and custom data, and they can be filtered for specific events.

## Creating an Event Report from a Template
To create a custom event report, follow the instructions in the Reporting Set-up chapter. This allows you to tailor reports to your specific needs.

## Displaying Event Reports on the Dashboard
To display an event report on your CiviCRM dashboard, ensure the report is available for the dashboard, then configure your dashboard to include the report.
