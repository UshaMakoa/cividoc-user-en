# Finding and viewing contributions

## Understanding contributions and contacts

In CiviCRM, contributions are the donations or payments recorded, while contacts are the people or organizations who make those contributions. When searching, it's important to decide whether you want to find specific contribution records or the contacts who made them. For example, if you want to send a thank-you gift, think about whether to send one gift per contribution or one per contact.

## Accessing the Find Contributions search

To find contributions, go to **Contributions > Find Contributions** in CiviCRM. This search lets you look for contributions based on different criteria.

## Searching for contributions

You can narrow your search by setting filters such as:

- Date range (e.g., last month, last year, or specific dates)
- Contribution amount
- Contribution status (e.g., completed, pending)
- Financial type (e.g., donation, membership)

The more filters you add, the more specific your results will be.

## Understanding search results

The results page shows a list of contributions matching your criteria. It also displays summary information like:

- Total amount of contributions found
- Number of contributions
- Average contribution amount

## Actions you can take on contributions

After selecting contributions from the results, you can perform several actions:

- **Update multiple contributions**: Change details like thank-you dates for many contributions at once (requires a pre-created profile).
- **Delete contributions**: Remove contributions completely (use with caution; editing and canceling is usually better for record keeping).
- **Export contributions**: Download contribution data; note that each contribution appears as a separate row.
- **Print or email receipts**: Create or send PDF receipts to donors.
- **Send emails**: Email contacts related to the selected contributions.
- **Print or email thank-you letters**: Generate custom letters for each contribution and optionally update thank-you dates.
- **Record payments**: Mark payments received for contributions with a "Pending (Pay Later)" status.

## Using advanced search for contributions

The Advanced Search lets you find contacts or contributions with more detailed criteria. You can choose to display contributions instead of contacts by changing the "Display Results As" option. This is helpful for complex searches like finding donors who contributed more than a certain amount and live in a specific area.

## Viewing contribution summaries and dashboards

The CiviContribute dashboard shows summaries of contributions over different time periods (month-to-date, year-to-date, and all time). You can view contributions in table format or as charts (bar or pie) to compare totals by month or year. You can also add contribution report dashlets to your personal dashboard to track things like top donors or financial types.
