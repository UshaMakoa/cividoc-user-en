# Exporting membership data


This guide explains how to export membership data from CiviCRM into a spreadsheet.  
 You’ll learn how to search for the memberships you want, choose which fields to include, and download your results for reporting, analysis, or sharing with colleagues.

It’s written for non-technical users who manage memberships and want to create custom lists or reports without needing advanced tools.

## **When to export membership data**

You might export membership data when you want to:

* Share a list of members with your team or board.

* Produce a mail merge or personalised email campaign.

* Analyse renewal trends or income in Excel or Google Sheets.

* Move selected data into another system or reporting tool.

CiviCRM’s export tool lets you choose exactly which records and fields to include so you can create tailored lists for your organisation’s needs.

## **Step 1: Find the memberships you want to export**

1. Go to **Search → Find Memberships**.

2. Enter your search criteria — for example:

   * Membership Type (such as “Individual Annual”)

   * Membership Status (Current, Grace, Expired)

   * Start or End Date range

   * Source or Contact Name

3. Click **Search** to see the results.

You can refine your search until you have exactly the list of members you want to export.

Tip: If you plan to export the same group regularly, consider saving your search as a **Smart Group** so you can reuse it later.

## **Step 2: Select records to export**

When your search results appear:

* Tick the box beside each record you want to export, or

* Tick the box at the top of the column to select all records in your results.

Then, from the **Actions** dropdown menu above the results list, choose **Export Members** and click **Go**.

## **Step 3: Choose export options**

CiviCRM will ask how you want to export your data. You can choose from:

* **Export PRIMARY fields only** – basic contact and membership details such as name, email, and membership type.

* **Select fields for export** – lets you choose specific fields across contacts, memberships, or custom data.

If you’re not sure which to pick, start with “Select fields for export” so you can choose exactly what you need.

---

## **Step 4: Select fields for export**

1. On the next screen, tick the fields you want to include.

   * Under **Contact Information**, you can choose Name, Email, Address, and Phone.

   * Under **Membership Information**, you can choose Membership Type, Status, Start Date, End Date, and Join Date.

   * If you have **Custom Fields** for memberships, they will appear here too.

2. Once you’ve selected the fields, click **Continue**.

CiviCRM will generate your file based on these selections.

## **Step 5: Download your file**

Your export will be created as a **CSV file** (comma-separated values), which you can open in Excel, Google Sheets, or another spreadsheet program.

When prompted:

1. Choose **Download File**.

2. Save it to your computer.

3. Open it to review the data and confirm it includes the fields you expected.

---

## **Step 6: Using your exported data**

Once you have your exported membership data, you can:

* Analyse renewal patterns or income using spreadsheets.

* Create charts or dashboards for reporting.

* Merge with other exported data such as contributions or events.

* Share the file securely with colleagues who need membership insights.

If your export contains personal data, follow your organisation’s data protection policies.

---

## **Tips and best practices**

* Keep exports small and targeted to avoid handling unnecessary personal data.

* Always delete old exports when they’re no longer needed.

* Use clear file names and dates (for example, “Members\_Current\_2025-10-21.csv”).

* Save commonly used field selections as templates to speed up future exports.

* Double-check that sensitive data (like financial information) is only shared with authorised staff.

## **What’s next**

Once you’re comfortable exporting membership data, you can:

* Build saved reports and dashboards for regular updates.

* Use **SearchKit** to design custom exports with advanced filters.

* Combine exports from memberships and contributions for income analysis.
