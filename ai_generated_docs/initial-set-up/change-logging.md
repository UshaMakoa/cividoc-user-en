# Logging in CiviCRM

## Understanding logging

CiviCRM helps you keep track of changes made to your contacts and other data through a feature called logging. Each contact has a change log that records who made changes and when, making it easier to manage your information.

## Detailed logging

When you enable detailed logging, CiviCRM tracks all changes made to your data. This includes:

- The previous value before the change.
- The new value after the change.
- The date and time when the change was made.
- The user who made the change.

With detailed logging, you can see a comprehensive history of changes, which can be especially helpful for maintaining accurate records.

## Activities vs. logging

While detailed logging is useful, you can also use activities to keep track of changes. Each activity represents a specific event in time, providing a timeline of changes to a contact. You don’t need to record an activity for every change, but combining activities with logging can give you a clearer picture of a contact's history.

## Membership logs

Membership records also serve as a historical log, showing contributions, renewals, and other relevant activities over time. For many users, this built-in logging may be sufficient without needing to enable detailed logging.

## Reverting changes

One of the key advantages of detailed logging is the ability to revert changes. If you make a mistake, you can easily restore previous data. For many fields, a revert button will be available. If you need to revert changes that don’t have a button, reach out to your system administrator for assistance.

By understanding and utilizing logging in CiviCRM, you can manage your data effectively and ensure that your records remain accurate and up-to-date.
