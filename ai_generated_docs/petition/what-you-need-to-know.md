# creating and using petitions in civicrm

## introduction
Petitions in CiviCRM are a feature of the CiviCampaign component, allowing you to collect responses from individuals. These responses are recorded as activity records of the type "Petition," similar to online surveys.

## key concepts
Petitions can be used independently or connected to specific campaigns. For example, a petition might be used to assess member satisfaction or as part of a broader campaign strategy. Understanding how petitions integrate with campaigns is crucial for analyzing responses in context.

## profiles and custom fields
When a site visitor signs a petition, a contact is saved, and an activity is created. Profiles are used to display fields for each signer, including email addresses, which are necessary for validating submissions. Custom fields can be used to collect additional information specific to the petition.

## cms permissions
To manage who can sign petitions, you need to set appropriate permissions for specific roles. Refer to the permissions setup chapter for details.

## planning your petition
Before creating a petition, consider your online strategy:

- **Email and Website Integration**: Will you send the petition via email or link to it on your website?
- **Social Media and Offline Strategies**: How will you promote the petition through social media or offline channels?
- **Messaging and Engagement**: How will you frame your message to encourage signatures, and what follow-up activities will you use to build relationships with signers?
- **Results and Follow-up**: What will you do with the petition results, and how will you continue engaging with signers?

This explanation provides a foundational understanding of petitions in CiviCRM, helping you plan and execute effective petition campaigns.
