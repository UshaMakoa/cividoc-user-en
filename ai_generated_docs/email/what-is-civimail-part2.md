# Understanding CiviMail

## What CiviMail does

CiviMail helps you send professional and targeted messages to groups of people in your CiviCRM database.

It's designed for bulk communication rather than one-to-one emails, and it automatically handles tracking, personalisation, and unsubscribe options to help your organisation communicate responsibly and efficiently.

CiviMail is often used for newsletters, membership updates, event invitations, campaigns, and donation appeals.

## Why use CiviMail

Using CiviMail means all your email activity stays within your CiviCRM system, connected to your contact records.

You can:

- Send bulk emails that are personalised and trackable  
- Manage who receives your messages with smart groups and filters  
- Automatically include unsubscribe links and respect opt-out preferences  
- Track who opened, clicked, or bounced so you can measure engagement  

This integration makes your communication easier to manage and keeps your data secure and consistent.

## How CiviMail works

CiviMail uses your existing contact records and group settings to decide who should receive each message.

When you create a mailing, you choose your audience, design your message, and set when it should be sent.

Behind the scenes, CiviCRM manages:

- Personalisation (such as greeting each contact by name)  
- Bounce handling (tracking invalid addresses)  
- Unsubscribe and resubscribe requests  
- Email delivery statistics and reports  

Everything is logged automatically, so you always have a full record of what was sent and to whom.

## What makes CiviMail different from normal email

CiviMail is designed for communication at scale. Unlike sending from your personal email account, it:

- Sends to large groups without exposing recipients' email addresses  
- Automatically follows data protection and unsubscribe rules  
- Provides detailed reports on delivery, opens, and clicks  
- Keeps all email history linked to each contact record  

These features make it especially useful for non-profits that rely on regular supporter communication.

## When to use CiviMail

Use CiviMail when you want to send:

- A newsletter or regular update to your supporters  
- A membership renewal or reminder to many people at once  
- Event invitations or follow-up messages  
- Campaign messages or appeals  

For individual or small-scale correspondence, continue using standard one-to-one emails from the contact record.

## Benefits for non-profit organisations

CiviMail helps non-profits stay connected with their communities while saving time.

You can:

- Target messages based on supporter interests or roles  
- Maintain consistent branding using templates  
- Track what works and improve future campaigns  
- Save on third-party mailing costs  
- Keep communication compliant with data protection policies  

## Related tools in CiviCRM

CiviMail works closely with other communication features in CiviCRM, such as:

- Scheduled reminders for automatic follow-up messages  
- Message templates for consistent design and content reuse  
- CiviRules for triggering emails automatically based on actions (such as joining, renewing, or donating)
