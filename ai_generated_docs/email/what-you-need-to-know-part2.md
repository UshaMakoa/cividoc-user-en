# Data protection and good mailing practice

Responsible use of CiviMail means respecting your supporters' privacy and following good data protection principles.

This page explains how to keep your mailing lists accurate, manage consent, and stay compliant with communication laws.

## Managing your mailing lists

Before sending any mailing, check that your contact lists are accurate and current.

Avoid sending to outdated or unverified email addresses.

You can manage lists using **Groups** or **Smart Groups** so that contacts are automatically added or removed based on their activity or membership status.

Best practice includes:

- Removing unsubscribed or bounced contacts regularly  
- Avoiding duplicate addresses  
- Reviewing group rules and filters occasionally  

CiviMail automatically manages unsubscribe requests and bounce tracking, so you don't need to handle these manually.

## Understanding consent

You should only send mailings to contacts who have agreed to receive them.

Consent can be given through:

- Sign-up forms on your website  
- Event registrations or membership applications with a clear opt-in  
- Direct communication where permission is recorded  

Keep a record of how and when consent was given.

## Unsubscribes and preferences

Every email sent through CiviMail automatically includes an unsubscribe link.

When someone unsubscribes:

- Their record is updated in CiviCRM  
- They are removed from relevant mailing groups  
- They won't receive future bulk mailings unless they resubscribe  

You don't need to manage this manually â€” CiviMail takes care of it automatically.

## Legal and ethical responsibilities

When sending mailings:

- Identify your organisation clearly in every message  
- Include a valid postal or contact address in the footer  
- Never share or sell email lists  
- Follow data protection regulations applicable in your region  

Good communication practice builds trust with your supporters and helps maintain your organisation's reputation.

## Testing and oversight

Before sending to large audiences:

- Test the email with a small internal group  
- Verify that personalisation fields display correctly  
- Confirm that unsubscribe links work  

If you encounter issues with deliverability, permissions, or tracking, contact your system administrator or support provider.

## Best practice

- Regularly review mailing performance and list quality.  
- Ensure only trained staff have mailing permissions.  
- Keep consent records organised and accessible.  
- Be transparent with supporters about what they can expect to receive.
