# Understanding CiviMail


CiviMail is CiviCRM’s built-in email tool for sending bulk emails, newsletters, and announcements to your contacts.  
 It helps you communicate with your supporters, members, or mailing lists directly from within your CRM, while keeping a record of every message sent.

This page explains what CiviMail is, how it fits into your wider communication strategy, and what makes it different from regular email.

## **What CiviMail is used for**

CiviMail is designed for sending messages to groups or segments of your contacts, rather than one-to-one emails. It’s commonly used for:

* Monthly newsletters or supporter updates

* Event invitations and reminders

* Campaign announcements

* Membership renewal messages

* Surveys or donation appeals

Each message is tracked, so you can see who received, opened, or clicked on your emails, helping you measure engagement and improve future communications.

## **How CiviMail works**

CiviMail uses the contact information stored in your CiviCRM database. You can send messages to:

* Specific groups or Smart Groups

* Search results (for example, everyone with a certain membership type)

* Entire segments of your database, such as all newsletter subscribers

When you send a mailing, CiviCRM automatically manages:

* Personalisation using contact fields (for example, “Dear {First Name}”)

* Unsubscribe and resubscribe links

* Email tracking (opens, clicks, bounces)

* Compliance with anti-spam and data protection requirements

This means you can send professional, compliant bulk emails without using external mailing lists or tools.

## **Components of a CiviMail campaign**

Each CiviMail mailing includes:

* **Recipients** – who will receive the message.

* **Subject and content** – your main message, which can include images, text, and links.

* **Templates** – reusable layouts that make your emails consistent and easy to design.

* **Mailing groups** – predefined contact lists to make sending faster.

* **Tracking and reports** – data on how recipients interacted with your email.

You can create a new mailing from scratch or reuse an existing one as a template for future messages.

## **Benefits of using CiviMail**

CiviMail offers several advantages for non-profit organisations:

* Keeps all supporter communication in one system

* Automatically updates contact records when emails bounce or people unsubscribe

* Lets you target and personalise messages based on any contact data

* Tracks performance so you can improve over time

* Complies with regulations such as unsubscribe management and bounce tracking

For many non-profits, using CiviMail means fewer spreadsheets, better targeting, and a more professional supporter experience.

## **When not to use CiviMail**

You don’t need to use CiviMail for every email you send.  
 For example, use regular one-to-one emails when you’re:

* Responding personally to an enquiry

* Following up on a specific action or meeting

* Communicating with staff or volunteers internally

CiviMail is best for planned, large-scale messages where consistency, tracking, and compliance matter.

## **Related CiviCRM tools**

CiviMail is part of CiviCRM’s broader communication toolkit, which also includes:

* **Scheduled reminders** for automated follow-ups and renewals

* **Email templates** for consistent branding and layout

* **CiviRules** for triggering emails automatically when actions happen

Together, these tools help you communicate more effectively while saving time.

## **Suggested page split**

For learning and clarity, this topic could be split into three shorter pages:

1. **Understanding CiviMail** – overview of what it is and when to use it

2. **Creating and sending your first mailing** – step-by-step guide for beginners

3. **Tracking results and improving future mailings** – how to review reports and measure success

This structure would help learners build confidence gradually, starting with basic understanding before moving on to practical tasks.
