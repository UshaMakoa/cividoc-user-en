# Cleaning your mailing lists

Clean mailing lists help your organisation reach real, engaged supporters.

## Why cleaning matters

Outdated or invalid contact data leads to:

- Higher bounce and unsubscribe rates  
- Wasted emails and false engagement metrics  
- Lower reputation for your domain  

## Reviewing bounces and unsubscribes

1. Review bounce and unsubscribe reports after each mailing.  
2. Remove invalid addresses.  
3. Investigate high bounce rates for patterns.  
4. Ensure unsubscribed people are excluded.  

Though CiviCRM automates this, manual checks improve data quality.

## Handling duplicates

Duplicates cause double mailings and bad reports.

- Use CiviCRMâ€™s duplicate checker regularly.  
- Merge contacts safely (keep history).  
- Standardise entry rules (e.g., lowercase emails).

## Best practice

- Review your list quality after every campaign.  
- Run duplicate checks quarterly.  
- Archive or remove inactive or invalid records.
