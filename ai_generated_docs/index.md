## scope of this guide

This guide is designed for people who use CiviCRM through its web interface. It covers all the tasks you can do inside CiviCRM without needing special technical skills.

## user guide vs system administrator guide

There are two main guides: this User Guide and the System Administrator Guide. The User Guide focuses on everyday tasks you can do within CiviCRM itself. The System Administrator Guide covers technical topics like installation and upgrades that need access outside the CiviCRM interface.

Some topics, like setup and configuration, appear in both guides but from different angles. If youâ€™re unsure which guide to use, start here for user tasks and check the System Administrator Guide for technical work.

## how to search the entire documentation

You can search all CiviCRM documentation easily from your CiviCRM dashboard by using a special extension called docbot. This adds a search box right inside CiviCRM so you can find help quickly without leaving your workspace.

## editing this guide

This guide is created and maintained by the CiviCRM community using a tool called MkDocs. If you want to help improve the documentation, there are simple instructions available to get you started.

## credits

This User Guide is a team effort by many community members, supported by the Documentation Working Group. Their ongoing work helps keep the guide useful and up to date.

**Suggestion:** To make the documentation easier to use, consider splitting content into separate pages such as "Getting started with CiviCRM," "User tasks," and "Technical setup" for more detailed topics. This helps new users find the right information without feeling overwhelmed.
