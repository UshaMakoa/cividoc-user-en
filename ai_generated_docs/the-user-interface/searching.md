# Introduction to searching in CiviCRM

In this guide, we will explore how to effectively search for contacts and data within CiviCRM. Whether you are trying to find a specific contact or gather information for a report, understanding the search features available will make your experience smoother and more efficient.

## Overview of search options

CiviCRM offers several ways to search for information:

- **Quick search**: A fast way to find contacts using basic criteria.
- **Advanced search**: A more detailed search option that allows you to filter results based on multiple criteria.
- **Full-text search**: This feature lets you search through all text fields in the database.
- **Component search**: Focuses on specific components like events or memberships.
- **Custom searches**: These are tailored searches created using CiviCRM's core or specific extensions.

Each method has its strengths and can be used depending on your needs.

## Quick search

The Quick search box is located in the navigation menu at the top left of your screen. It allows you to search for contacts by name, email, and other criteria. Here’s how to use it:

1. Click in the Quick search box and start typing.
2. You can search by name, email, or other criteria depending on your settings.
3. As you type, a dropdown will show matching contacts. You can select one from the list or continue typing for more specific results.

Remember, you can modify the Quick search settings by going to **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Search Preferences**. Here, you can adjust what fields are included in your searches.

## Advanced search

For more complex searches, the Advanced search feature allows you to filter results based on various criteria. Here’s how to use it:

1. Navigate to **Search > Advanced Search**.
2. You will see different sections for various types of data, such as demographics, contributions, and events.
3. Expand the sections by clicking on the blue bars (accordion style) to access specific search fields.

You can combine multiple criteria to narrow down your search results. For example, you can search for all contacts from a specific country who are also part of a particular group.

## Display settings for results

When using Advanced search, you can choose how to display your results. By default, results show as contact records, but you can change this to display other types of records, such as memberships or contributions. Use the **Display Results As** dropdown to select the format you prefer.

## Combining search criteria

You can combine different search criteria using "AND" or "OR" operators. For example, if you want to find contacts who are both members and volunteers, you would use the "AND" operator. If you want to find contacts who are either members or volunteers, use the "OR" operator.

## Limitations of Advanced search

While Advanced search is powerful, it does have some limitations. For instance, it may not filter activities correctly when contacts are involved in multiple cases. Keep this in mind as you perform your searches.

## Full-text search

The Full-text search feature allows you to search for specific words across all text fields in your database. This is especially useful if you remember certain details but not the exact contact name. Simply enter the words you recall, and CiviCRM will return relevant results.

## Component searches

Each component in CiviCRM, such as contributions or memberships, has its own search functionality. These searches work similarly to Advanced search but focus on the specific data related to that component. For example, you can find all contributions made during a specific time frame.

## Search results actions

Once you have your search results, you can take various actions. An Actions box appears above the results, allowing you to select records and perform tasks such as adding contacts to a group, exporting data, or sending emails.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to effectively use the search features in CiviCRM will greatly enhance your ability to manage contacts and data. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, these tools will help you navigate the system with confidence. Happy searching!
