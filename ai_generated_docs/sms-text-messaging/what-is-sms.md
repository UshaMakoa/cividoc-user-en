# What is SMS?

## Introduction to SMS

SMS stands for Short Message Service, which means the text messages you send and receive on your mobile phone every day. In CiviCRM, SMS lets you send and receive these text messages directly through the system.

## Why use SMS in CiviCRM?

Using SMS in CiviCRM gives you another way to communicate with your contacts besides email. This can be especially helpful when:

- Internet access is limited or unreliable, but mobile phone coverage is available  
- You want to collect quick responses or information from people in remote areas  
- You are running an SMS marketing campaign  
- You need to send alerts and reminders  
- You want to notify event participants about last-minute changes like location or time  

SMS messages are a fast and direct way to reach people, making your communications more effective.

## How SMS fits into your work

SMS can be used alongside your other communication tools in CiviCRM to keep your contacts informed and engaged. Itâ€™s a simple, accessible method that can improve your outreach, especially for non-profits working in diverse or hard-to-reach communities.
